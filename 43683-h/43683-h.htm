<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>SAVED BY QUICK WIT.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hold</span> on there, I want a word with you!"</p>

<p>Billy Barry and Henri Trouville, the Boy Aviators,
were in the act of climbing into a superb military
biplane on the great parade ground at Hamburg
when thus hailed by a mild looking man in
citizen's attire, with face half-hidden by a slouch
hat and a pair of huge, horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>There was a note of authority in that voice, gently
tuned as it was, and behind those spectacles were
a pair of eyes as keen as gimlet points.</p>

<p>The speaker was none other than Roque, the
noted secret agent&mdash;"Herr Roque," if you please,
fitting into his masquerade as a merchant having
contract business with the authorities of the canvas
city of aëroplane hangars.</p>

<p>"Come over to quarters for a few moments,
young sirs, won't you?"</p>

<p>The polite manner of request was for the benefit
of the bystanders, who had been awaiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
flying exhibit, but the slight gesture that went with
the words indicated a command to Billy and Henri.</p>

<p>They knew Roque!</p>

<p>Heinrich Hume, aviation lieutenant, who usually
had a good deal to say on those grounds, made no
more protest than a clam at this interruption of a
special aëroplane test. He simply waved two other
aviators on duty into the machine, as Billy and
Henri marched meekly away with the imitation
merchant.</p>

<p>While many of the spectators marveled at the
apparent breach of discipline, the lieutenant was
content to let them wonder. At least, he offered no
explanation.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri did a lot of thinking as they
crossed the parade ground&mdash;there must be something
brewing, or Roque would not have been so
impatient as to invade the parade ground at the
time he did.</p>

<p>Roque conducted the boys into Lieutenant
Hume's private office at headquarters, closed and
locked the door behind them.</p>

<p>Removing his spectacles, and throwing his slouch
hat among the maps that littered a big table in
the center of the room, the secret agent at the same
time changed his form of address&mdash;the oily manner
was succeeded by abrupt and stern speech, which
showed the real man of brain and unlimited authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The secret agent had seated himself, without invitation
to the boys to do likewise. They stood,
facing the real Roque they knew by former experience.</p>

<p>"Where is Ardelle?"</p>

<p>Roque put the question like a pistol shot, and
fiercely eyed the youngsters before him.</p>

<p>The point-blank query failed to reach the mark
intended.</p>

<p>Billy looked at Henri and Henri looked at Billy,
and then they both looked at Roque with never even
a quiver of an eyelash. They had not comprehended
what was behind the dreaded agent's snapshot
at their nerves. The truth of the matter was,
they did not know anybody by the name of "Ardelle."</p>

<p>So Billy, with a bold front, remarked: "You
can't prove it by us, sir. Mr. Ardelle is not in our
list of friends."</p>

<p>"None of that!"</p>

<p>Roque pointed a menacing finger at the astonished
pair of youngsters.</p>

<p>"I have it beyond doubt that Ardelle was on
these very grounds a day or two ago, and by the
word of a man who could not be mistaken. Fool
that he was not to be sure at the time, and only
the garb of a sailor to mislead him."</p>

<p>Then it jointly dawned upon the minds of Billy
and Henri that Anglin, the smiling secretary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
eminent director of affairs at Calais, and later in
the rôle of a bubbling sailor here in faraway Hamburg,
must be the Ardelle about whom Roque was
talking.</p>

<p>They realized, too, that through their boyish delight
in lending aid and a helping hand to one they
had known in intimate association with that best of
friends in France, they had unconsciously maneuvered
themselves into a dangerous game, a slip in
which meant a dance with death.</p>

<p>A tissue message from this very suspect that
Roque was so eager to apprehend even then burned
against the breast of Henri, a little wad of paper
that now represented the price of the world to a
pair of bright boys.</p>

<p>Condemned of mixing in the battle of wits between
the grim Roque and his strongest wily rival
from over the sea, and it were better that the young
aviators had tumbled from their aëroplane during
the last high flight.</p>

<p>But those who traveled in spirit with Billy Barry,
the boy from Bangor, Maine, U. S. A., and his
plucky teammate, Henri Trouville, in France and
Belgium, can assure that it is no easy task to catch
this pair napping.</p>

<p>The courage tempered by that first and continuous
baptism of fire was good steel for any emergency.</p>

<p>Roque owned to himself that his quickfire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
failed to get results. His informant, himself just
returning from a secret mission on hostile soil, had
noted the movements of the sailor suspect on the
aviation exhibit day, and also the attitude of Henri
at the moment when the message was passed. But
of the message itself, the reporting agent could
have no knowledge. He was not near enough to
detect a trick so deftly done.</p>

<p>Roque and Ardelle had measured brains many a
time and often, but heretofore at long range, and
the former had never seen the latter in person. Had
such been the case, the French agent's invasion of
the empire would have ended at Bremen, when these
two masters of craft had both been guests at the
same time of the same café.</p>

<p>Roque's unerring judgment had convinced him
after the first question that the boys had no knowledge
of the name Ardelle. Their first profession
of ignorance was too real to be mere acting. The
boys took care that the light that came to them as
Roque proceeded did not shine in the direction of
the lynx-eyed questioner.</p>

<p>The rigid lines in the face of the secret agent
relaxed. These boys, after all, had once served him
a good turn, with a skill, courage and fidelity far
beyond the ordinary, and, perhaps, he was not sorry
that he had apparently found them guiltless.</p>

<p>"Now, young sirs," said Roque, resuming the
manner of the merchant, "I have another little journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in store for you. I don't know for certain
that it will prove as exciting as the last jaunt we
took together, when you located a shipload of guns
for me, but maybe so, maybe so.</p>

<p>"After we have made our excuses to the lieutenant,"
he continued, "we will go over to my humble
home in the city, where I have some new clothes
for you. I do not think you are warlike enough
to want to travel in any sort of uniform, especially
with a simple tradesman like myself."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Billy's tongue to ask Roque
why he kept up that sort of talk with those who
knew him without his mask, and when there was
no purpose to be served, but Billy concluded that he
had better let well enough alone.</p>

<p>A roomy carryall was in waiting at the further
end of the parade ground, toward which the merry
old merchant led his young friends, with a hand
under the elbows of both. It was pardonable for
the aviation lieutenant to grin when the trio were
passing, after making their excuses.</p>

<p>It had not, however, occurred to Henri to smile
a response. He was just then indulging in a cold
perspiration, caused by a leaping thought that Roque
might personally supervise their change of garments,
and in that curious way of his light upon
the tissue billet pinned on the inside of his (Henri's)
shirt-front.</p>

<p>Because they had not fully understood the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the dimly dashed message, Billy had suggested
that they keep it for another sitting. The
paper wad had not then turned into a torpedo.</p>

<p>Roque's house might have belonged to a retired
gardener rather than to the man with the iron grip
who claimed it as home. The dooryard blazed
with red flowers, and the well-kept lawn was lined
by earth beds spangled with blooms in colors beyond
count.</p>

<p>"Welcome, young sirs."</p>

<p>Roque waved the way into a wide hall, at the
end of which yawned a great fireplace. Bowing
before them the boys saw the tallest man they had
ever met outside of a sideshow, a very giant, who
wore a long gray coat, with a good day's output
for a button factory in front.</p>

<p>"This is my man of business, young sirs&mdash;Paul
Zorn."</p>

<p>The "young sirs" instantly formed the opinion
that Zorn would have no trouble in cracking a cocoanut
between the row of glittering teeth he displayed
when Roque so introduced him.</p>

<p>"We are going to put our young friends into
store clothes, Paul. I hope you will be able to
properly fit them, and it will also be my care that
you do."</p>

<p>"Confound the man," thought Henri, "he has
never since he called me out of the machine shifted
his eye long enough for me to get a hand on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
tissue, and now he's going to act as my valet. He's
just full of suspicion."</p>

<p>Billy, also, had been figuring some in his mind
just what would break loose if Roque should find
the sailor's note in Henri's possession. All of the
powers of argument this side of the North Sea
would then avail nothing in the matter of convincing
Roque that he had not been double-crossed.</p>

<p>The only crumb of comfort that Billy felt he
could hope for if the drop fell was that Roque would
quit his comedy acting behind the scenes for the
once&mdash;but that was scant comfort, surely, under
this cloud of anxiety.</p>

<p>The boys soon knew what Roque had meant by
"store clothes," for it was a regular storehouse of
the styles of all nations that the makeup magician
maintained in the second floor back of his Hamburg
home&mdash;uniforms galore, the garb of the fighting
man in the Old World war, known under the folds
of Britain's Union Jack, the Tricolor of France, the
black double-headed eagle of Russia, the sable Cross
of the German Empire; the attire of the dandy
civilian, the sedate tradesman, the student, the clerk,
the livery of house and carriage service, and, indeed,
what not?</p>

<p>"A nice little collection, young sirs," observed
Roque, which remark again prompted the giant
Zorn to display his mouthful of shining molars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you think Paul would look in this outfit?"</p>

<p>Roque indicated on the display rack a regulation
English uniform of olive drab, with puttees, and
a cap of the traditional French arms shape, but of
khaki color.</p>

<p>Even if the boys had been in the mood to say
that Zorn would look like the Eiffel tower in any
sort of uniform, Roque gave them no time to break
in upon his humor.</p>

<p>"Nothing like keeping up-to-date, young sirs, in
my business. It was only a few weeks ago that
this new style French soldier first appeared in
Havre. And here we can make his mate in a minute
or two."</p>

<p>This cat and mouse play was wearing on Billy
and Henri. Free of anxiety, they might have enjoyed
digging into the maze of disguises as they
would the pages of a popular detective story, but
they had a play of their own to make, and no chance
yet to make it.</p>

<p>"Now, Paul, how will we fix up these young
flyers for a bit of ground work? Something plain,
yet neat, I think, will do for the sons of Doctor
Blitz&mdash;I am Blitz to-morrow, I believe, Paul?"</p>

<p>Zorn simply showed his teeth. He was not expected
to answer.</p>

<p>"Now, my bird boys, get out of those uniforms
and I'll make a pair of likely students out of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Do you prefer Heidelberg, the School of Arts, or
the Conservatory? No matter, though, it is just
a shift for a short journey, and I guess I can make
you up to pass muster."</p>

<p>All the time Roque was chatting principally for
the amusement of himself and Paul, his hands were
busy sorting a pile of clothing and he was ready to
start a couple of young Blitzes into society in the
most finished style&mdash;from glazed cap to shiny shoes.</p>

<p>It was just at this moment that Billy was seized
suddenly with a fit of laughter, and his high glee
was directed at Henri.</p>

<p>"Won't you set 'em going in that layout!" he
howled.</p>

<p>With that he made a jump for his chum, as if
to hurry the process of transformation. The playful
effort commenced at the throat and scattered a few
buttons. Henri resisted the attack, and for a second
or two held Billy in close arm lock&mdash;time
enough for the assailant to get a pin-jab in the
thumb, and a wad of tissue paper in the clench of
four fingers!</p>

<p>Roque viewed the antics with a frown of impatience,
but the assistant of grenadier size roared
his approval of the fun.</p>

<p>Henri was brisk enough then in taking off the
old for the new, and by the time Billy commanded
attention there was no occasion for worry.</p>

<p>Billy had swallowed the tissue!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>A STIRRING HOLIDAY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> be rudely routed out of a snug nest in a
feather bed at 3 o'clock in the morning&mdash;a morning
with a real chill in it&mdash;is not a desirable experience
for the average house-bred boy, and even such seasoned
campaigners as Billy Barry and Henri Trouville
were inclined to grumble when the giant Zorn
yanked the covers from their downy couch and
gruffly ordered them to get up and dress, and to
make haste about it.</p>

<p>By the pale gleam of a couple of candles, and
the slight warmth from a newly kindled fire in a
white china stove, the "Blitz boys" made their
toilets of the interesting characters they were to
assume.</p>

<p>"What time is it anyway?" yawned Henri.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm not good enough in higher mathematics
to figure it out for you," growled Billy, as
he tussled with leather shoestrings that tied, he said,
"seven ways for Sunday."</p>

<p>The voice of "Dr. Blitz" sounded at the foot of
the stairway, in the lower regions of the house.
There was no "young sirs" about it. The "good
merchant of Hamburg" was on vacation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Crawl lively there, you snails," were the words
that ascended.</p>

<p>"Wonder what tip he is working on now?" whispered
Billy.</p>

<p>"You will never know until you get to it." Henri
had before been impressed with the fact that Roque
was not in the habit of springing until he got on
the board.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Dr. Blitz," was Billy's cheery
greeting to the man who was making hasty breakfast
at a table drawn up before a crackling fire in
a big brick cavern. He could not have testified
from side view that it was Roque, so he took a
chance on "Blitz."</p>

<p>Along with a gulp of coffee the imposing person
addressed shot a remark in German over his shoulder,
which Henri afterward explained to Billy was
very near to profanity.</p>

<p>The boys edged into chairs at the table, but missed
a round of muffins through staring at the "doctor."</p>

<p>The merchant masquerade was wholly outclassed
by this new display of the make-up art.</p>

<p>Billy wanted to say "ring the night bell," but
sheer admiration kept him silent.</p>

<p>Whether it was the combined effects of the steaming
coffee, hot muffins, and a big black cigar that
followed, or the silent tribute in the eyes of his
young guests, it was, nevertheless, a speedily noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fact that Roque was thawing into more gracious
manner.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that it is only a few hours
now until Christmas, and we must find some special
way to observe it."</p>

<p>Billy and Henri could not get the straight line
on Roque's remark, but later realized that the holiday
was of the like they had never before passed.</p>

<p>With a cutting wind from off the icy flow of the
mighty river Elbe in their faces, the boys followed
their leader to the docks, where they boarded a
small craft, evidently built for speed, which had
steam up and manned for instant start.</p>

<p>The captain was the same who commanded the
deck when the boys had accompanied Roque on a
previous exciting excursion. This official, standing
at attention, stiff as a ramrod, gave no visible
mark of recognition as the passengers boarded the
boat, but Billy could have sworn that he saw something
like a twinkle in the captain's right eye when
they passed the gangplank.</p>

<p>"No use asking where we are bound for," lamented
Henri.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of use," agreed Billy.</p>

<p>They were out of earshot of Roque, whose tall
form, in rusty black, was outlined in the dawnlight
near the wheel of the churning steamer.</p>

<p>The first intimation of what was to be their next
landing place came in the word "Cuxhaven," passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by one sailor to another. The talk was in rapid
German, but Henri caught the drift of the conversation
without difficulty.</p>

<p>"By George," he whispered to his chum, "Cuxhaven
is the place mentioned in Anglin's message."</p>

<p>"You mean Ardelle's message," corrected Billy.</p>

<p>"That's right," chuckled Henri. "I forgot that
Anglin had become the big noise. Yes, it's the very
place," he continued, "and it's a great naval base."</p>

<p>"It's a safe bet that Roque never hits a trail
that isn't warm. Take it from me," and Billy was
in great earnest when he said it, "there is going
to be something doing."</p>

<p>Billy's prediction chanced, in this instance, to be
more accurate than are some of the forecasts made
by professionals.</p>

<p>It was in a dense fog that Christmas eve when
the little steamer ceased chugging in the wide mouth
of the Elbe, and the harbor lights burned blue. The
captain condemned the weather in no uncertain
terms, but Roque seemingly had no care for aught
but his thoughts, as he leaned against the rail, with
moody gaze fixed upon the anchored ships and the
dim lines of the city beyond.</p>

<p>As he had shaped, not long ago, the famous
raid of the German fleet upon English seaports,
Roque did not underestimate the ability of his great
rival, Ardelle, to open the way for a counter attack.
Ardelle was known by the secret service to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
be on this very soil&mdash;and, surely, for some big purpose.
Minnows were not sent to stir up a pool of
this size.</p>

<p>"But they'll find no sleepy towns to blow up
here," said Roque to himself.</p>

<p>He was all for precaution, however, and his intuition
was nothing short of marvelous.</p>

<p>When "Dr. Blitz" and his "sons" went ashore it
was the foggiest kind of a Christmas morning.</p>

<p>A stalwart marine attempted to put the doctor
through the question paces, but the real Roque whispered
a fierce something into the ear of the would-be
questioner that set the latter back-tracking in
a jiffy.</p>

<p>It was a curious and remarkable fact, but true,
that an hour after the eminent secret agent and
his young charges had landed in Cuxhaven, Billy's
prediction, "that wherever Roque is there's something
doing," was verified. Every submarine cable
connecting the fortresses of this coast sounded
alarm, particularly high-keyed the frantic signal
from Helgoland, the fortress island, thirty-nine
miles away.</p>

<p>Roque dropped his doctor character like a hot potato
when he learned the import of the flashes. He
tossed his traveling case of surgical instruments into
the first open doorway he passed, and the boys were
compelled to run to keep up with his long stride.</p>

<p>Bombs were falling from aloft, exploding among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the shipping behind them, while in front one of the
projectiles crashed upon a huge gas tank.</p>

<p>"The nerve of the devil mapped this out!"</p>

<p>The bitter emphasis of Roque indicated that he
laid the blame of this unexpected invasion upon one
head&mdash;that of Ardelle.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the fog-ridden atmosphere was
riven by blazes of powder from the shore guns,
trained upward, and the air squadron, Zeppelins and
naval seaplanes, were leaping skyward to meet their
kind in aërial battle.</p>

<p>Roque charged madly into the air station, dragging
the boys after him.</p>

<p>A seaplane was balanced on the polished ways
for the sweeping plunge.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Emperor!" he shouted, shouldering
aside the men holding the poised craft. The
same fierce whisper in the ear of the aviation lieutenant
had effect identical with that upon the marine
at the docks.</p>

<p>"Get to your places, you moonfaces"&mdash;this stern
command hurled at the boys. Henri bounced into
the motor section, Billy settled behind the rudder
wheel, and Roque swung himself into the bow seat.</p>

<p>The long hull was launched with the snap of
training, and with motors humming left the water
without a wrench from its skimming start.</p>

<p>The Boy Aviators, certified masters of the air,
were at their trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>They had need of all their skill and daring that
day!</p>

<p>"Set your course northwest," loudly ordered
Roque. "Hit for Helgoland like a bolt."</p>

<p>"Look out that you don't hit something on the
way!" shouted Henri from the rear.</p>

<p>The last warning was timely, if Billy had need
of warning at all. There was peril in the foggy
stretches.</p>

<p>The upper regions were literally lined with aircraft.
No less than seven naval seaplanes had traveled
in advance of the British warship invasion of
the German bay. Having dropped all the bombs
they could through the mist, they were in full return
flight to the convoying vessels. Zeppelins and
hostile seaplanes zigzagged on their trail, and other
dirigibles and fighting craft menaced their retreat
still further on.</p>

<p>Billy guided the seaplane he was driving to the
higher strata in order to escape mix-up with the
contending airships, but on the thirtieth mile recorded,
Roque, who had constantly demanded distance
figures, ordered a lower flight, and, the fog
clearing, the flyers could plainly see on the waves
far below the floating warcraft of the invaders&mdash;light
cruisers, destroyers and submarines. The
Germans were combating this array with aircraft
and submarines, but so great was Roque's impatience
to reach the fortified island that the motors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
were put by Henri to the limit of speed, and so
that part of the conflict is not in the record of the
Aëroplane Scouts.</p>

<p>Just off Helgoland, though, the boys had the
shock of noting the crumpling of one of the British
seaplanes and the end of a brave airman.</p>

<p>"There's no escape when death stalks you up
here," sighed Billy.</p>

<p>"Ware away, boy," called Roque, when the seaplane
hovered over Helgoland, "wait until they see
the color of the bottom of the machine or we will
look like a sieve before we light."</p>

<p>Billy "wared away," and with motors at half
speed, the seaplane circled over the supposed most
impregnable stronghold in the world, awaiting some
signal of recognition from the fortress.</p>

<p>It was finally given, and Roque directed immediate
descent.</p>

<p>On the ground once more, Billy and Henri relapsed
into their dutiful service as "sons" and rear
guards of the renowned "Dr. Blitz." The glazed
caps had gone the way of the winds, but, as Billy
put it, "we are still dressed up to beat the band."</p>

<p>The boys noticed that, barring a few skilled workmen
and engineers, they were the only civilians in
the streets that evening. They did not count Roque,
for he might turn out to be a general, if occasion
served.</p>

<p>The latter had a busy hour with the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
officers, while the boys had an idle one, with about
as much activity as is allowed a hobbled horse. It
was evident that "Dr. Blitz" held this island as a
holy of holies, secret even to his "sons."</p>

<p>"It beats me," observed Billy, edging away as
far as possible from the guard stationed to keep
them out of mischief, "how those Britishers ever
got by this place."</p>

<p>"The bigger question," asserted Henri, "is, if
they got by, how in the world did they ever get
back?"</p>

<p>"That's what Roque is evidently trying to find
out," intimated Billy.</p>

<p>The boys, while puzzling over the problem of
"get by and get back," were looking at the huge
fortress so tremendously fortified and noting everywhere
an uninterrupted view of the sea.</p>

<p>They also surmised that an alert garrison was
ever carefully watching the waters, day after day,
night after night, hour after hour, in order not to
be surprised by the powerful enemy.</p>

<p>"I guess the fog helped some," was the conclusion
finally advanced by Billy.</p>

<p>"And Ardelle somewhere behind the curtain,"
suggested Henri.</p>

<p>"Oh, go 'way, man; Roque has given you the Ardelle
fever."</p>

<p>Billy just then caught sight of Roque bearing
down upon them under full stride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak of the dickens," he exclaimed, "here he
comes now."</p>

<p>The shadows of evening continued to gather, and
here and there on the island lights showed like
glowworms. Roque shook hands with his officer
companions. He evidently contemplated leaving in
the same impetuous way that he came, but evidently
not by the seaplane route.</p>

<p>A little steam launch tugged at its holding rope,
in readiness to dash away into the misty deep. Two
men muffled to the throat waited the order. Roque,
with never a word to the boys, directed them by
gestures to get aboard, quickly following. The
launch cut through the now pitchy darkness of the
Helgoland waters. With the island lights no longer
visible, there could only be seen the lantern in front
of the little boat, and it was a dangerous speed to
be making, when the helmsman had scant view of
hardly a yard ahead.</p>

<p>But the man at the wheel was in familiar element,
to him, and the scudding vessel never came
to drift movement until a glimmering signal guided
to the landing place, the name of which would have
meant nothing to the boys if they had had the care
to inquire.</p>

<p>This was Christmas night in the Bight of Helgoland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>A THRILLING MOMENT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> oak rafters, festooned with dried herbs,
and toasting their feet at the cheery blaze of an
open, roaring fire, the boys regained the Christmas
spirit that had been sorely subdued in the previous
dismal hour in the wave-tossed launch.</p>

<p>The house that had thrown open a hospitable door
at the bidding of Roque overlooked the bay, and its
solid walls had resisted the storms of a half-century.
Mine host, Spitznagle, had he been dressed
for the part, would have come very near to the Santa
Claus idea, and even as he was, some of the idea
hung about him in a radiant circle.</p>

<p>He could not, though, have possibly trimmed a
tree in manner more satisfactory than he decorated
the big, square table in the center of the wooden-walled
dining-room, within easy distance of that
first-class fire. Sizzling sausages, small mountains
of crullers, fragrant coffee, mulled cider, and such
like in quality and quantity, indicated a royal spread.</p>

<p>Roque, who had been prowling around somewhere
outside for a time, suddenly preceded a gust
of sleety wind into the cozy interior.</p>

<p>The Christmas spirit had apparently conjured up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a bit of a kindly spell for him, as the iron man fitted
into the scene with far less friction than the boys
had anticipated, considering the mood of this driving
force during the trying day.</p>

<p>"Snug haven, this, eh?" jovially queried the late
arrival, as he spread a pair of sinewy hands over
the inviting fire. "You're spoiling these youngsters,
Spitz," was Roque's side remark to the blooming
boniface, at the moment stirring some savory stew
in a glistening copper pot. Mine Host waved a
three-foot spoon in mock protest against the playful
accusation.</p>

<p>"Nothing like that at all, my dear man," he declared
in big bass tone. "I will not spoil but will
cure these children of their hunger."</p>

<p>"Draw up, my hearties," urged Roque, setting
example by dragging an oak bench alongside of the
bountifully laden table. Billy and Henri jumped
at the bidding.</p>

<p>"Where are the men that brought us over?" asked
Billy, presuming upon the fact that Roque was in
one of the rare periods out of his shell.</p>

<p>"Back, I hope, where they came from," briefly
replied Roque. "Those fellows are hardy stock,"
he added, "and can see in the dark. Don't worry
about them."</p>

<p>"Cuxhaven is some aircraft place, isn't it?"
Henri put this wedge in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," acknowledged the secret agent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
"and" (grimly) "it may soon return the upper-story
visit just paid with a cloudful of warcraft
that will start a general hunt for cover."</p>

<p>"Had you ridden often in airships before to-day,
Mr. Roque?" inquired Billy.</p>

<p>Spitznagle muffled a chuckle by a slight fit of
coughing when he heard the question, and muttered
something to himself like "donner vetter!"</p>

<p>Roque turned a quick eye upon the fat offender,
and then gave Billy a smiling look-over before he
made response.</p>

<p>"I confess, young man, that I have enjoyed some
lofty travel before I met you, but I am willing to
admit that I could not teach you and that partner
of yours many new tricks in flying the heavier than
air kind of machines."</p>

<p>"How about the Zeppelins?" cried Spitznagle,
who could no longer suppress a desire to show his
knowledge of Roque's prowess as an airman.</p>

<p>"Hold your peace, Arnold," advised the secret
agent, shaking his finger at the eager champion, "my
business compels me to learn a little of everything,
and it's all in a day's work, anyway."</p>

<p>The boys were satisfied that Roque's renown had
not all of it been won on the ground. Spitznagle
would have made a good witness to that effect if he
had been permitted to speak.</p>

<p>While the tall clock in the turn of the winding
staircase leading to the upper floor of the old house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was whanging the twelve strokes of midnight,
Roque and Spitznagle pledged the fatherland with
uplifted goblets, and Billy and Henri offered a silent
toast to the assured soft beds upstairs.</p>

<p>When the early morning brought no disturbance
of their inclination for a little longer time to press
the pillows, the boys sleepily guessed that Roque,
for once, was not in a hurry to dash into new territory.
As the sun kept climbing, and still no summons
from below, curiosity overruled napping, and
the young aviators decided to investigate the cause
of this unusual consideration of their comfort.</p>

<p>Halfway down the stairway their ears convinced
them that the place was not deserted, for a spirited
conversation in the language of the country was
in progress, accompanied by a clatter of dishes,
and the ever present cooking odor of sausage assailed
their noses.</p>

<p>Besides Spitznagle, shrouded to the rib-line with
his flowing apron, were three very short men and
an extremely long one. The latter proved to be
no other than the giant Zorn. Roque was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>The heavy host noisily hailed the late comers:</p>

<p>"Good morning, sleepyheads, and all this fine food
waiting for you, too."</p>

<p>Zorn gave his best wide-mouthed grin, and then
went on talking, in lower tones, however, to his
short companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy and Henri made a substantial breakfast, and
in doing so, hardly felt the need of the constant
urging of the boss cook.</p>

<p>They could not imagine what had become of
Roque, and as nobody volunteered to tell them, they
concluded not to ask any questions.</p>

<p>The boys observed that one of the short men,
with a large head wholly out of proportion with
his stocky body, commanded much deference from
the rest of the party.</p>

<p>Henri learned from the drift of the conversation
that this determined looking individual was
Capt. Groat of Friedrichshaven, the great center of
Zeppelin factories, and while the captain was not
in uniform he had the manner of rank.</p>

<p>Billy was quietly advised by his chum what the
talk was about, and wagered that the two strangers
were airmen.</p>

<p>"When these fellows commence to flock together
on this coast," he asserted, "you can figure on what
Roque meant when he fixed a comeback to get even
for that flying raid yesterday on Cuxhaven."</p>

<p>The boys had withdrawn to the fireplace, and had
an opportunity to exchange comments and conclusions
between themselves.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take a whirl myself in one of those
Zeppelins," was the wish expressed by Henri.</p>

<p>"Our flying education has been sadly neglected
in that respect," admitted Billy, "but, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
these dirigibles are among the things made only in
Germany, and we're just over, so to speak."</p>

<p>As the morning wore away, Zorn made some remark
to Capt. Groat that had attracted the latter's
attention to the boys lounging at the fireplace. The
captain arose from the table and approached Billy
and Henri with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"You speak the German?" With the question he
bestowed a strenuous grip upon each of the boys.</p>

<p>Henri nodded, and Billy confessed by blank look
that he did not know the language.</p>

<p>"It is easy, the English," politely assured the captain,
"and we will talk it together."</p>

<p>Billy brightened at this. He was not fond of
hearing through an interpreter.</p>

<p>"I hear you are the great aviators, and for so
young it is wonderful."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," was Henri's modest acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"It is with the Zeppelin I navigate," advised the
captain. "You know it not?"</p>

<p>"Not much," put in Billy, "though we once dangled
on the anchor of one, and another time I fell
with a monoplane right across the back of one of
your dirigibles."</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked Henri, "and if it hadn't been
for that, there wouldn't have been any Billy alive to
tell about it."</p>

<p>The captain showed a disposition to continue his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
talk during the afternoon with the boys, but a new
arrival of evident importance interrupted. This
addition to the party was a much older man than
the rest, wore a military cloak, and his long, gray
mustache curled at the ends in close touch with his
ears. As he stood at the end of the big table, now
cleared of its cloth, and rested a hand, enveloped
in a gauntlet, upon the shining surface, everybody
in the room saluted. Over the shoulder of this
distinguished guest the boys saw the face of Roque.</p>

<p>As if by signal, further increased by the hasty
entrance of three additional numbers, the attending
company ranged by equal division on each side of
the table, and all followed the directing movement
of the man at the head of the board in seating themselves.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were the only bystanders, for
though Spitznagle had not ventured to flop down
upon a bench at the table, he perched himself on a
high stool, completely blocking the door leading into
the pantry.</p>

<p>One of the short men who had first appeared with
Capt. Groat produced a capacious wallet, and laid
out in orderly array a number of neatly folded papers
which had been contained in the leather.</p>

<p>"This is the navigator detailed to determine air
currents, sir," explained Roque to the chief figure,
at whose right elbow the secret agent was stationed.</p>

<p>The man in the cloak fixed his gaze on the expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with the notes. The latter accepted this as
permission to speak, and read in precise manner
the results of close observation during a recent
aërial expedition of Zeppelins, escorted by armed
German biplanes, in the vicinity of Dover straits.</p>

<p>Henri's quick ear and thorough knowledge of
the Teuton tongue put him in line of complete understanding
of the report, and that it seemed preliminary
to a proposed general raid of aircraft on
territory with which he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>Billy's only satisfaction was in watching his
chum's change of expression as the news sifted
through the latter's mind. He could see that there
was "something doing."</p>

<p>So intently interested was the gathering at the
table in the reading, that the very existence of the
youthful outsiders seemed to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Good; excellent!" commented the chief.</p>

<p>"It's a game with double trumps." Roque held
the affair at Cuxhaven as a choking memory.</p>

<p>"There'll be quite a fall of hot shot, I promise
you, if we get started right." This was the prediction
of Captain Groat.</p>

<p>His lieutenants from Friedrichshaven nodded
their approval.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a telling counterstroke by their
air squadron, the plan makers at the table puffed
up clouds of smoke from pipes and cigars, freely
distributed by the happy Spitznagle when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lengthy discussion officially ended. In the added
hours, when stone mugs were passing among the
thirsty, night had fallen outside, and the benches
were turned to the glowing fire.</p>

<p>While Spitznagle was touching the tips of numerous
candles with the tiny flame from a paper spiral,
the empty mugs were being removed by an oddly
dressed fellow, who shuffled around in carpet slippers
like he was tormented with a thousand pangs
of rheumatism.</p>

<p>The boys had boosted themselves to good lookout
points on the wide window ledges, behind the
lively circle around the fire.</p>

<p>The leather wallet and the survey notes of the
expert air traveler lay separate and apart on the
table, just as they had when the reading concluded.</p>

<p>Billy was idly watching the halting action of the
queer servitor, when, to the great astonishment of
the watcher, the apparent cripple, with rapid hand
movement, under cover of the wiping cloth he carried,
deftly lifted and concealed the papers somewhere
in the scarecrow garments he wore.</p>

<p>It was a tense moment. The word that would
have turned things upside down in that room trembled
on Billy's lips. But one of those remarkable
instances of mental telegraphy checked the utterance.
The man who had stolen the papers felt that
his action had been detected from an unexpected
quarter, and his eyes lifted to the very point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
danger. There was an appeal in the look&mdash;and
something else, a flash of recognition that compelled
a response. They were the smiling eyes of Anglin&mdash;or,
as Roque would have it, Ardelle.</p>

<p>Billy, tongued-tied, saw the bent figure slowly
shuffle toward the kitchen. He inwardly trembled
at the thought of the stocky airman suddenly turning
from the fireplace to seek his precious reports.
He added another little shake in advance of the
turmoil that was bound to be raised, anyhow, no
matter how soon or how late the loss should be
discovered. But the consolation of delayed discovery
would be that Anglin had a chance to save
his neck.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, pal?" Henri had
just noticed that Billy was off color and wide-eyed
as a trapped rabbit.</p>

<p>Billy, for caution, laid a finger on his lips. "I've
seen a ghost," he whispered.</p>

<p>With a glance of apprehension at the group circling
the fireplace, Billy leaned against the shoulder
of his chum and with underbreath speed told of
the presence of Anglin and the taking of the papers.</p>

<p>Henri was thrilled by the exciting story poured
into his ear, and immediately took on his share of
anxiety as to the outcome of Anglin's daring action.</p>

<p>Bursts of laughter resounded at the fireplace. The
company was then applauding some humorous tale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
volunteered by Zorn, who had risen like a tower
to impress the point of his story.</p>

<p>"Gee," murmured Billy, "will they never quit?"</p>

<p>"Don't fret," advised Henri, "the blow will fall
in due time."</p>

<p>It did fall a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The main mover of the meeting was saying:
"Gentlemen, it is nearing a new day, and there is
great achievement before us. We go to prepare
for it."</p>

<p>Benches were pushed back to clear the way, and
this scraping sound had hardly ceased when the
short airman, who had made the interesting report,
hurried to the table for his valuable records.</p>

<p>The boys leaned forward in breathless suspense.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small>THE STOLEN PAPERS.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> papers! The report! Has anybody seen
them?"</p>

<p>The owner of the wallet shook it vigorously over
the table, to assure himself that he had not replaced
the records there, and then quickstepped the whole
length and around the board, lowering his head
again and again beneath the polished surface to see
if the documents he was excitedly seeking could
have possibly fallen on the floor.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Roque, starting forward.
"You've lost the papers, you say?"</p>

<p>"I didn't lose them," almost shouted the airman,
"they were left on the table, and if they're gone,
they've been stolen."</p>

<p>"Hey, my friend," remonstrated Spitznagle, "we
have no thieves in this house, and no enemies to
the cause."</p>

<p>"This is no time to bandy words," roared Roque,
"shut and bar the doors"&mdash;this last command directed
at Zorn. The giant jumped at the bidding
and sent the bolts rattling into their sockets.</p>

<p>The savage energy of Roque ruled all to silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Even the power under the cloak refrained from
advising.</p>

<p>The secret agent dismissed suspicion as to the
active participants in the conference, and as to the
loyalty of Spitznagle he had not the slightest doubt.
The trial horses must needs be two pale-faced boys
backed up against a window-sill.</p>

<p>Roque, with his hands deep in his pockets, a habit
he had when stalking a suspect, walked around the
foot of the table and stood directly in front of the
pair, fixing on them that gimlet gaze he used to terrorize.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, when at bay, were the most
keenly alive; their nerve always served them most
in the supreme test.</p>

<p>They faced their inquisitor without an outward
tremor; their previous anxiety was known only to
themselves, and now admirably concealed.</p>

<p>Roque realized that he had no fluttering birds
in his hands, and also was aware that a search of
their persons was only required to acquit or convict
these youngsters of the actual theft. He knew that
they had not left the room, though why he had
not long ago sent them upstairs to bed was a slip
of mind he could not account for. But it had occurred
to Roque that the boys had been in a position
to see the table all the time since the company
adjourned to the fire, and whatever had happened
in regard to the papers they, if not the light-fingered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
chaps themselves, must have witnessed the
perpetration of the steal. So he changed his tactics.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," he began with insinuating address,
"there is a very ugly situation here, and as I have
always heretofore found you dependable, cannot I
now depend upon you to help me clear this up?"</p>

<p>Henri shook his head, in denial for both. "Search
us," he said.</p>

<p>Roque, whose remarkable judgment of human
nature has before been noted, felt in an instant that
the suggested search would develop nothing.</p>

<p>"Who took the papers then?" he fiercely demanded.</p>

<p>"We were not on guard duty." Billy was inclined
to resent this bullying, and showed it by his answer.</p>

<p>"Strip them," urged the short airman, who
thought he, as the loser, ought to have a word in
the controversy.</p>

<p>Roque waved the man away, and then abruptly
moved to where Spitznagle was sitting, a picture of
despair.</p>

<p>"Who was in the house to-night besides those now
present?" was the question fired at Mine Host.</p>

<p>"Nobody but Conrad," assured Spitznagle.</p>

<p>"Who the devil is Conrad?" Roque fairly jumped
at this information.</p>

<p>"Why, a poor crippled fellow, as queer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
head as he was in the legs, that I had helping in
the kitchen. He lost his job as cook on the coast
line steamer <i>Druid</i> on account of rheumatism, and
they sent him up here to me."</p>

<p>"'They sent him up,' did 'they?' And now when
did 'they' send him up?"</p>

<p>"About a week ago. But what's all this about
Conrad you're asking, Roque? I'll have him in, and
you can judge if he is worth a moment's notice in
this kind of affair." Spitznagle started for the
kitchen door, Roque at his heels.</p>

<p>"Conrad, Conrad," called Spitznagle.</p>

<p>"Conrad" had flown, leaving nothing behind him
but his rheumatism and a dingy apron.</p>

<p>"Yell till you're hoarse, you fathead," raged
Roque, "and the cows will come home from nowhere
before you get an answer."</p>

<p>While Spitznagle was staring into vacancy, Roque
stormed back into the dining-room and announced:</p>

<p>"We've been the dupes of that spy Ardelle. Nobody
but he could have gotten away with a venture
like this. But" (gritting his teeth), "I'll beat him
yet. I say, Vollmer" (turning to the aërial recorder
now minus his records), "you have the whole
thing in mind and we'll strike while the iron is hot.
We may outride the warning, for he can't get it
flashed from this coast."</p>

<p>The man in the cloak came to the front on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
proposition. "The word is 'immediate,'" he proclaimed.</p>

<p>A speedy departure was in order, and Roque
crooked a finger at the young aviators, bidding
them follow.</p>

<p>"You are going to be mighty useful, my flying
friends," he said, "and you'd better be." There
was grim emphasis in these last words.</p>

<p>At noon the next day the boys were again tramping
around after Roque in Cuxhaven. The character
of "Dr. Blitz" was no longer in the play.
Roque was trimly set up as an aviation lieutenant,
and it was really wonderful how easily he merged
into each part he assumed. "Students" no longer,
Billy and Henri were happy in resuming their flying
clothes.</p>

<p>"Best becomes our style of beauty," as Billy
would have it.</p>

<p>There seemed to be some unforeseen reason for
delay, as the aërial expedition did not start forthwith,
as intended. Indeed, it did not start from
Cuxhaven at all. It might have been that Ardelle's
theft of the guide records had put a spoke
in the German wheel, but as to that the boys could
only hazard a guess.</p>

<p>It was on the twentieth day after the adventure
in the house of Spitznagle that the young aviators
again had the opportunity of operating a seaplane
with Roque as directing passenger, and the uninterrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
flight brought them to the island of Amesland,
for though Cuxhaven was counted as the airship
base, it evidently was the intent to project the
return attack on the English coast from the out-to-sea
point before named.</p>

<p>What an array of the warcraft of the "upper
deep"&mdash;the great dirigibles, seaplanes, destroyer, artillery
spotter and scout aëroplanes. The boys were
in their element. Even Roque had a smile for their
enthusiasm. It was not the war spirit that animated
Billy and Henri&mdash;they reveled in the show
as airmen delighted with the life.</p>

<p>In this camp were none but the suicidally brave
type of fighters, and it was only that kind fit to
essay the trackless line of three hundred miles over
the sea. From what the boys, or, rather one of
them, Henri, could learn from the camp talk, a pair
of the latest Zeppelin dirigibles were to participate,
but the main movers of this attack were evidently
to be airships of the small, non-rigid Parseval build,
for bomb work. The truth of the matter was, the
young aviators, at the order of Roque, were so
taken up with the tuning of a seaplane just before
the fleet went aloft that they could not have listed
the starters with any degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>They only knew positively that they were going
aloft, and their own machine would require their
individual attention. About 8:30 that night the
glare of a powerful searchlight from one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
German airships directed its rays over the heart
of the English city of Yarmouth. Two bombs
dropped almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>The boys saw the city below suddenly plunged
into darkness. Five more bombs were hurled from
the sky. The fleet then swiftly moved northeast,
and more bombs crashed into the town of Kings
Lynn. Roque had assumed no active part as a
leader in the deadly maneuvers&mdash;his was a thinking
assignment. It was midnight when the fleet
turned eastward and fled back across the North
Sea.</p>

<p>"It might have been London," muttered the secret
agent, "if the game could have been played
without a break."</p>

<p>Preparations to repel just such an invasion had
been made in the great city.</p>

<p>Ardelle must have gotten his warning across, but
the coast towns failed to heed it.</p>

<p>The Roque machine kept its speed when the
balance of the fleet checked flight at Amesland. The
secret agent was bound for Cuxhaven, doubtless to
plan another tiger spring at the foe. He was all
for air campaigning these days.</p>

<p>"You will witness the sight of your lives, you
young cyclones, before last night's mist of the North
Sea dries in your hair."</p>

<p>This significant remark on Cuxhaven docks set
the boys in the highest state of expectancy. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
seldom that Roque billed anything ahead of time,
and surely something extraordinary must be in the
wind.</p>

<p>Three days later, from a dizzy height, they witnessed
a sky battle without parallel in military annals,
and which dimmed the memory of any of their
previous remarkable experiences in the war zone.</p>

<p>The French coast town of Dunkirk, to which the
boys had on a happy day gone by been delivered
by submarine and taken away in a seaplane, was
the ground center of this spectacular conquest of
the air&mdash;the first of its kind in the history of the
world.</p>

<p>Twenty hours earlier a fleet of British seaplanes
had bombarded the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, held
by the Germans, news of which had soon after
reached the mystery man, Roque, by way of one
of the innumerable channels of communication with
which he kept himself constantly in touch.</p>

<p>The German bird craft suddenly appeared over
Dunkirk like a flock of gigantic sea gulls.</p>

<p>Explosive missiles fell as fiery hail upon the town.
The tocsin sounded in the high tower of Dunkirk
church, and the blue and white flag of the town was
run up.</p>

<p>The roar of the fort guns, firing shrapnel, was
heard, and all around the German fliers white puffs
were bursting, as the pilots guided their machines
in low-swooping spirals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>In compliance with the snappy commands of
Roque, Billy circled the seaplane to every point of
observation vantage, while the secret agent viewed
the action of the armored Aviatik biplanes, dashing
here and there with the sun glinting on their
steel sides.</p>

<p>"Look there!" shouted Henri, rising and clutching
a stay to preserve his balance. The air was clear,
and the scene was open even to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Billy, at the wheel, risked a glance sideways.</p>

<p>A squadron of British aviators, encamped on the
outskirts of Dunkirk, had taken the air to engage
the raiders.</p>

<p>One speedy biplane darted straight toward the
German craft. Henri saw the aviator clutch the
levers of his machine in one hand and with the
other unsling a rifle, beginning fire at a German
birdman below him.</p>

<p>A half dozen armored aëroplanes of the raiding
force swarmed in upon the daring Briton. His
machine was peppered with lead, and it was apparent
that the man had been wounded as he dipped
toward the earth to evade the encircling Germans.</p>

<p>Other English aviators swept into the whirling
combat, and to the rescue of their wounded leader.
The raiders turned toward the north, now being
shrapnelled by anti-aircraft guns stationed along the
coast.</p>

<p>Roque pointed upwards, signalling for rapid ascent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and at six thousand feet the seaplane, with
tremendous burst of speed, soon overhauled and
outdistanced the slower warcraft, making a wide
detour over the sea, thus avoiding the volleys of
rifle shots from the Allies' infantry near Nieuport.</p>

<p>Roque, looking at his watch, turned to Billy, just
behind him, remarking:</p>

<p>"That much in fifty minutes is not often recorded&mdash;of
these things they shall sing on the Rhine."</p>

<p>In Bremen the boys paid grateful tribute to rest
after the strain and stress to which they had been
put by their relentless taskmaster.</p>

<p>"I feel," said Billy, "like the hump between my
shoulders is going to be permanent, and I couldn't
keep my elbows down to save my soul."</p>

<p>"If I could only get the whirr out of my ears,
I'd be satisfied," was Henri's complaint.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the boys found
relief from the kinks in their backs, and were ready
and eager for the next move in their adventurous
careers.</p>

<p>Just around the corner from their hotel was the
very café where they had the thrill of seeing Anglin's
face in the mirror while they were dining
there with Roque.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be funny if Anglin were to bob up
again while we are here?"</p>

<p>"I think, Billy, that it would be a tragedy if Roque
had any inkling of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you hold the thought for a moment, Henri,
that you could catch the Calais weasel asleep. Oh,
I say, there's a concert on downstairs," quickly concluded
Billy, as the notes of violin and piano were
wafted above. "Let's hunt the music."</p>

<p>A high tenor voice was merging into the accompaniment
when the boys reached the floor below,
and they saw that the singer was one of the curly-lock
type, and in evening attire.</p>

<p>What of the eyes, though, that gleamed upon the
Aëroplane Scouts as they stood in the doorway&mdash;the
artistic make-up could fool them, but there was
no mistaking the smiling orbs under the blackened
eyebrows.</p>

<p>Fox tracks were mixing again!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> vocal efforts of this new favorite had called
forth round after round of applause, for good music
never went amiss in Teuton territory.</p>

<p>Among the vigorous hand-clappers the boys noted
a well-groomed man, apparently about forty, wearing
an affable manner and the best clothes that the
continent can produce.</p>

<p>Henri nudged Billy. "Size up Roque, won't you,
please, and isn't he a dandy?"</p>

<p>Billy was first inclined to doubt the identity of
their taskmaster, who a couple of hours ago was
a far cry from being in the glass of fashion. Never
before had the boys seen him in that sort of rig.</p>

<p>"You're dead right, Henri, it is the old scout.
He's a corker, sure!"</p>

<p>This note of admiration had scarcely sounded
when Roque was joined by a slender, wiry individual,
also set up as a swell, with a shock of sandy
hair, and sporting a monocle.</p>

<p>The fellow with the quizzing glass had apparently
moved to get a better view of the singer, as well
as to get in touch with the secret agent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonder if that's the man who spotted Anglin
on the parade ground at Hamburg?"</p>

<p>"Don't let your imagination run away with you,
Henri," advised Billy, who in speaking was careful
not to indicate that his attitude was anything but
careless.</p>

<p>The sandy-haired man was taking the same precaution,
but Henri, nursing the idea that would not
down, was more and more impressed with the belief
that the elegant figure was seeking the measure
and not the music of the warbler at the other end
of the room.</p>

<p>If the singer had sized up the situation, it had
not affected his rendering a bit of light opera that
was just then exciting an encore. There was nothing
at all the matter with his German or with his
voice.</p>

<p>Nobody apparently was more delighted than
Roque, and he appeared to be expressing his opinion
to the wiry listener beside him.</p>

<p>The latter bowed politely and then sauntered
toward the revolving door leading into the lounging
section of the hotel, fingering a cigar as he proceeded.</p>

<p>Henri edged around nearer to the piano, the
player of which was completing the program with
a national air, the melody of many voices aiding
the performance.</p>

<p>Billy had hardly realized the desertion of his chum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
when he saw that Roque had changed his position,
and was standing nearest the door leading to the
street. The secret agent shifted something from
his hip to the sidepocket of his coat, and Billy
caught the glitter of that something in the swift
movement. The boy guessed then that there was
trouble brewing.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Henri, in an innocent sort of
way, pushed still closer to the pianist, who was hitting
the high notes in fine style.</p>

<p>As he passed within a foot of the singer, now
idly posing, with an elbow on the piano top, he,
without turning his head, joined in the triumphant
chorus, but changed two words at the climax, and
"beat it" reached Anglin's ear.</p>

<p>The French sleuth never moved a muscle, and
it was as if the warning had been passed to a man
stone deaf.</p>

<p>Anyone posted, however, would have known that
within an arm's length of Anglin was a wall switch
which controlled the electric lights by which the
room was so brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>Billy had just had the experience of being rather
rudely thrust aside by a couple of burly troopers,
who seemed inspired to get as quickly as possible
into the very center of the select circle.</p>

<p>"Get him!"</p>

<p>As this command rang out the astonished pleasure
seekers started a panic, as if an alarm of fire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sounded. There was a rush for every doorway,
but every way of departure was blocked by stalwart
guardsmen.</p>

<p>Billy was not among those who tried to break
through the doors&mdash;he was dodging among the
charging force sent in by the loud orders to "get
him."</p>

<p>Click! The room was suddenly shrouded in
darkness, penetrated a little distance only by the
lights beyond the entrance of the lounging room
section.</p>

<p>The pursuing force, working from several directions,
ran into one another's arms. The pianist,
familiar with the place, leaped for the electric
switch, and turned on the flood of light.</p>

<p>Everybody was present but the singer!</p>

<p>Henri had a perch on the keyboard of the piano,
which he had sought to save a mad tramping on his
feet.</p>

<p>"Set you to catch a weasel," sneered Roque, as
the sandy-haired man stood staring at the shattered
casement of the tall window overlooking an inner
court of the hotel.</p>

<p>"He can't get clear away," retorted the sandy
one.</p>

<p>"Stop him then," challenged Roque. "Don't
stand there like a stoughton bottle."</p>

<p>The pursuers scoured the building from bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to top, and every street and alley roundabout, but
it was a case of looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p>Roque was in a black mood. Once more baffled
by his cunning chief adversary, the only one
he acknowledged in his own class, and on his own
stamping ground&mdash;it was a bitter dose for the master
craftsman.</p>

<p>Did he remember how he himself had spread a
web over Britain, woven so finely that even Scotland
Yard could not see it? Yet he rebelled at the
like cut of a diamond.</p>

<p>"Stir your stumps," was his peremptory address
to the boys, and they trotted to catch his long stride
out of the hotel.</p>

<p>The sidewalks on both sides of the street were
crowded with curious onlookers, attracted by the
reported doings inside.</p>

<p>Roque bucked the line like a football star, and
Billy and Henri followed in the cleared space without
special exertion.</p>

<p>"He doesn't care whom he pushes," observed
Billy, as he listened to angry protests along the
line of travel.</p>

<p>Both of the boys were eager to talk over the
latest disappearing act of that wonderful Anglin,
but not so anxious as to take chances with Roque
in earshot.</p>

<p>The secret agent turned into a silent side street,
and stopped before a heavily grated door in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
gloomy front of a solid stone building that was a
skyscraper in height. Reaching through the grating,
he evidently opened way of communication
with the interior, for in a moment or two a glimmer
of light splintered through the barred entrance, the
ponderous lock creaked, and the door swung back
on its massive hinges. A skull cap and a gray beard
showed behind the lamp shining in the doorway.
Roque pushed the boys ahead of him, and their
closing in was marked by a clang behind them.</p>

<p>They followed their guide through a long corridor
and into a modern high-power elevator, that
shot noiselessly upwards. It was a circular room
into which they stepped, the very tip of a tower,
and a wireless telegraph apparatus was there in
operation.</p>

<p>"How is it working?" promptly questioned Roque
of an operator who was off his turn, and relieved
of his headgear.</p>

<p>The man jumped to his feet, all attention, and
replied: "There's been hardly a break for an hour,
sir."</p>

<p>Here was one of the hidden intelligence stations
that accounted in part for Roque's ability to get
searching and quick information. That he should
initiate the boys into his particular secret service
methods indicated a determination that they should
never get away from him.</p>

<p>As Billy said to Henri at a chance moment, "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thinks we are booked for a life job as his air
chauffeurs."</p>

<p>They were not aware as yet that in the extensive
grounds, housed at the water's edge, was the seaplane
in which they had recently traveled so far,
and in addition a big biplane and two monoplanes
were in hangars ready for service. Also the most
speedy of steam launches rested at the private
wharf.</p>

<p>Roque was a recognized genius, like every cog in
the German wheel, absolutely thorough in his methods,
and the means placed at his disposal were practically
limitless.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri had climbed into the steep embrasure
of a tower window and were enjoying the
magnificent view spread out before them.</p>

<p>"How about my imagination now?" Henri was
recalling exciting incidents in the hotel. "Didn't I
get the figure of the sandy man as a spotter?"</p>

<p>"I think you did," admitted Billy. "But," he
continued, "I didn't take much stock in the idea until
I saw the revolver in Roque's hand. Then I
knew that the fat was in the fire."</p>

<p>"I gave Anglin the cue to beat it, and I did the
trick by breaking into that Rhine song," exclaimed
Henri. "Yet he never made a move until the yell
of 'get him,' and I thought the jig was up, sure.
He's the coolest hand in the business, that fellow."</p>

<p>"Some of these days, maybe, he'll fall a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
short in one of those getaways, and that will mean
a tumble into six feet of earth."</p>

<p>"Not he," stoutly maintained Henri, "he's the
regular man with a charmed life. Say, I can't help
laughing even now when I think of Spitznagle calling
'Conrad,' and the expression on Roque's face."</p>

<p>Billy gave Henri a kick on the foot. Roque was
approaching with a sheaf of telegraph messages in
his hand.</p>

<p>"What are you boys jabbering about? I want
you to go down to the wharf with Albert and get
the seaplane in trim. I'll join you in half an hour."</p>

<p>Albert, a strapping youth, with the breezy way
of a sailor, guided the boys across the grounds to
the hangar, and watched with interest the making
ready of the airship.</p>

<p>"That's not my kind of a boat," he briskly stated,
"but I'll be bound if this kind of craft didn't give
us submarine workers a Christmas surprise. Ever
travel in a submarine?"</p>

<p>"We had a ride in one that we will never forget,"
replied Henri, as he applied the oil can to the big
motors.</p>

<p>Billy, busy with the steering gear, was not expected
to answer, as he did not understand the question.</p>

<p>"It is all a question of ups and downs, anyhow,"
went on Albert, "bombs from above and torpedoes
from below."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This trade discussion ended with the arrival of
Roque, who had severed himself from style and
was again in aviation attire.</p>

<p>"Now, my carrier pigeons, you are in for a homing
flight, that is, Hamburg; and it may be some
time before you again get a breath of this port."</p>

<p>With this assurance the seaplane was launched
and took the airline for Hamburg, leaving Albert
to his own devices.</p>

<p>The travelers soon had sight of Zorn's ever-ready
grin at the home of "the well-known tradesman."</p>

<p>"We've been through a lot since we were last
hauled out of these feathers," remarked Billy, as
he bounced into the bed pillows that night.</p>

<p>Happily, "coming events do not cast shadows"
for sound sleepers.</p>

<p>Roque had departed for the city before the boys
charged into the breakfast room.</p>

<p>"He has gone to the store," announced Zorn,
who uncovered his teeth an extra inch, in compliment
to his own humor.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to see Lieutenant Hume," proposed
Billy, after breakfast.</p>

<p>"Just the ticket," agreed Henri, "I'm crazy to
get a peep at the old flying quarters again."</p>

<p>But Zorn objected to any move that Roque had
not ordered.</p>

<p>The boys had to be satisfied with the prospect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
for to run against Zorn would be akin to tackling
a mountain.</p>

<p>When Roque returned, sure enough, he was again
playing the merchant&mdash;horn, spectacles, and all.</p>

<p>"Ah, young sirs, kindly waiting for the weary
worker?"</p>

<p>"Same old blarney," muttered Billy.</p>

<p>Zorn chuckled as he relieved the "merchant" of
his hat and overcoat.</p>

<p>"Some time ago I believe I told you that here
you were only balancing on the edge of the great
empire, and there might be an opportunity for you
to see much more of the country. The opportunity
is at hand. I have been called by trade interests
further afield, and as I cannot consent to a separation,
you will continue as my companions."</p>

<p>In his hour of relaxation, Roque really enjoyed
this sort of word play, and he eyed the boys to see
if they appreciated the fact that all of the best
actors were not on the stage.</p>

<p>He was sure of Zorn's sincere appreciation. This
man had seen the chief in many parts.</p>

<p>Henri accepted the cue, and, with a profound
bow, and a hand on his heart, replied in kind:</p>

<p>"My dear Herr Roque, we would grieve if you
left us behind."</p>

<p>"What of you?" Roque turned to Billy.</p>

<p>"Oh, anything goes with me." The boy from
Bangor always hit straight from the bat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The last evening of many in Hamburg was a very
pleasant one to the boys. Roque's intimate knowledge
of London and Paris was displayed in entertaining
way, with no reference to his own exploits
as the cleverest conspirator that ever invaded court
and palace. He expressed regret that he had never
seen America, and induced Billy to tell about Boston
and Bangor.</p>

<p>It may also be recorded that with this evening
the boys unconsciously said good-by to the character
of the Hamburg merchant. They went far
with the many-sided man, but never again saw him
in the rôle imposed by this big city on the Elbe.</p>

<p>When the boys retired they left master and man&mdash;Roque
and Zorn&mdash;conversing before the fire.
With the coming of the morning, the journey to the
unknown began, and the Aëroplane Scouts had no
idea of its purpose or their assignment in the new
sphere of action.</p>

<p>That it would, however, include further conquest
of the air they might have guessed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>A FLYING VICTORY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a great day for the boys when they set
foot in imperial Berlin, with its palaces, art galleries,
museums, parliament building, monuments,
magnificent parks, and over all its martial spirit.</p>

<p>Roque, by which name, it might be mentioned,
he was not known in this heart of the empire, soon
demonstrated to his charges that he was the man
higher up by his manner of getting about, and the
high cost of living had no worries for him.</p>

<p>"Who'd have thought that we would be hitched
up to a ten-time winner like this?" Billy was content
for the time being to be allied with power.</p>

<p>Among the many who answered the summons of
Roque in the intelligence bureau, the young aviators
were most interested in a score of blond, blue-eyed,
well-set-up Saxons, renowned as Zeppelin navigators,
who were destined to guide the "terrors of
the air" in furtherance of another raiding plan
taking form in the fertile brain of the eminent promoter
of trouble for the enemy.</p>

<p>While the boys had faith only in the heavier-than-air
machines, they conceded that the risk taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
by the Zeppelin crews entitled the latter to brush
elbows with the crack flyers of the other kind of
bird craft. It was also true that when a Zeppelin
got anywhere it was a tremendous factor in war.
And it was no question but that the Fatherland
had gone Zeppelin mad.</p>

<p>Woe betide the hostile airmen who dropped the
bomb on the Zeppelin works at Friedrichshaven if
Roque had the means of catching them. It was
only another score that he had marked up against
Ardelle, whom the master agent of the empire
charged with planning this destructive performance.</p>

<p>"Roque said he was going to show us where these
gas cruisers grow," Henri advised Billy one evening,
getting this news while his chum was engaged
in an argument with a Zeppelin worker.</p>

<p>"Something I've been wanting to see," exclaimed
Billy. "I owe something to a Zeppelin, even if it
is like a balloon."</p>

<p>This last was a sort of side swipe at the man who
had been on the other side of the argument.</p>

<p>"There is one thing sure, these dirigibles can't
camp out." This was Billy's first remark in Friedrichshaven.</p>

<p>He was peering into a big steel-framed shed with
a glass roof which housed one of these grim engines
of the air&mdash;a great cylinder flanked by platforms.
This newest of the huge airships was about
the length of a first-class battleship, and the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the young aviator that it could not drop anywhere
and everywhere like the aëroplanes he drove
was not a prejudiced one.</p>

<p>When Henri had a look at the powerful motors
he was impressed with their capacity to drink up
petrol at a most appalling rate.</p>

<p>"What's her top speed?" he asked one of the big
fellows who had traveled over from Berlin with
them.</p>

<p>"Forty-five miles in the calm," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed Billy. "We could get a seaplane
home for breakfast while they were waiting
supper on you!"</p>

<p>"Yet," claimed the Zeppelin expert, "it's the car
they're all afraid of."</p>

<p>"It certainly does look like a scaremark," admitted
Henri, who remembered a certain evening on
the Belgian coast, when he was one of the company
aboard a stranded hydroplane dragged ashore by
the swinging anchor of a Zeppelin, which loomed
overhead like a cloud, and buzzed like a million
bees.</p>

<p>A gang of at least a hundred men swarmed about
the shed when the order issued for a trial trip of
the new super-Zeppelin, a sample of the fleet in
course of building, and Roque carefully noted every
detail of equipment.</p>

<p>The gas chambers were fed with pure hydrogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
no common coal gas, and many thousand cubic
meters were in the flow of this one envelope filling.</p>

<p>"Guess they'd have to carry a hydrogen factory
around with this outfit to keep it going," observed
Billy, as he noted the elaborate process.</p>

<p>"Not that bad," advised the man at his elbow,
"this gas can be transported from the factory in
cylinders under pressure."</p>

<p>"Just think of it," put in Henri, "I heard them
say just now that it took thirty gallons of petrol
an hour to buzz these motors."</p>

<p>"Biggest thing I know in the air business. I wish
Captain Johnson could see an expense bill like this.
He'd have a fit." Billy would, indeed, have counted
it a red-letter occasion if his old friend, and the boss
airman of Dover, were really at hand to take in this
show.</p>

<p>To go aloft in an airship about which they were
not thoroughly posted was a brand-new experience
for the boys, but they were not in the least degree
like the proverbial cat in a strange garret. It was
easy riding, and none of the guns pointed their way.
Billy carried a memorandum of a British military
biplane, with a record of 10,000 miles, which Henri
and himself had once patched up, that had been hit
by 250 rifle bullets and sixty fragments of shells.
He wondered if the immense craft in which they
were sailing could have floated with, proportionately,
about ten times that amount of lead poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
into her. But Billy, of course, did not then know
much about Zeppelins.</p>

<p>Roque, however, was eminently well satisfied,
particularly with the improved method of distributing
explosives where they would do the most
harm. The airship had a special armored compartment
for bombs near the propellers and a big gun
mounted in front to destroy aëroplanes. "Get a
fleet of these over the English channel," he proclaimed,
"and somebody would think that hell had
been moved upstairs!"</p>

<p>"I'll say this much," announced Billy, "I'd take
an ocean voyage for my health if I knew when they
were coming."</p>

<p>"But if the fighting crowd over there had the date
and the hour, I'll promise you that the reception
your fleet would receive would be warm enough to
boil an egg." This was Henri's prediction.</p>

<p>"We never advertise," grimly remarked Roque.</p>

<p>When the Zeppelin had completed her trial trip
and had again been housed by the small army of
workmen, Roque informed the boys that he was going
to give them the chance on the morrow to show
their mettle in a biplane test, which was to decide
the relative merits as to the speed of two special
designs.</p>

<p>"I am going to put you up to jockey the machine
that I favor," he said, "and, mind you, the aviators
that will drive against you are among the finest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
our flying corps. I always pick my men by personally
knowing what they can do in any line of
action. They seldom fail me, and it is with you to
make good."</p>

<p>"We're going some, Herr Roque, when we come
up to your standard," replied Henri.</p>

<p>"See that you are 'going some' at the finish of
the race to-morrow," laughed Roque.</p>

<p>"It will be because something breaks if we don't
hit the high mark," assured Billy.</p>

<p>"Go over and size up your winged steed," directed
Roque, pointing to a hangar across the field.
"Show them No. 3"&mdash;this to one of the attendants.</p>

<p>"This is no mosquito," announced Billy, after
a view of the fine lines of "No. 3."</p>

<p>"Speed there, I tell you, old boy," was Henri's
comment as he walked around the rigging, "and
carrying armor, too."</p>

<p>In an hour the boys had fully comprehended all
the new features of this up-to-the-minute machine.
They had been builders themselves and knew a good
stroke of the business when they saw it.</p>

<p>Returning across the field, Billy and Henri were
introduced to the rival aviators by Roque. The
German airmen were a jolly pair, and showed by
the professional courtesy they exhibited to the two
of their kind that the coming contest was wholly a
friendly one, and the results to be of value to the
flying corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. 2 is a little older than your machine," was
the greeting of one of the Teuton experts, "but it
can hold its own."</p>

<p>Roque, speaking for his champions, gaily disposed
of this claim:</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open to-morrow, Fritz, or you
will get lost somewhere in the rear."</p>

<p>"No fear, sir; there are no cobwebs on No. 2."</p>

<p>"What are they talking about, Buddy?" asked
Billy.</p>

<p>"They just think they are going to beat us, that's
all," interpreted Henri.</p>

<p>A bright clear morning presented itself for the
aërial race, and Lake Constance lay like a broad
mirror under the sunlight. The course was set due
north and straightaway for twenty miles, and the
turn fixed at a high point called Round Top, upon
which, Roque informed the boys, a tall flagstaff had
been mounted.</p>

<p>There were no preliminary trials, for both machines
had been carefully groomed, and each was
as fit as a fiddle.</p>

<p>With the aviators up the biplanes scudded down
the field for the rise, and got away upon almost
equal terms, the German drivers slightly in the lead,
through better acquaintance with the lay of the
ground. They trailed a yellow streamer, while the
boys floated a band of black.</p>

<p>The ascent reached 2,000 feet, when the machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
darted north like arrows. Roque and a group of
officers about him followed the speeders through
field glasses.</p>

<p>"They would run a swallow to death," remarked
the secret agent to the aviation lieutenant at his side.</p>

<p>The aëroplanes had dwindled in the vision to
mere specks, and there was no telling which was in
the fore.</p>

<p>"Ah, they are headed back!" cried Roque. "Now
for the show-down."</p>

<p>The glasses revealed the specks moving twin-like,
and such was the terrific onrush that the crowd
surging in the field soon caught a view of the contestants
in growing size.</p>

<p>One enthusiast shouted: "Fritz will shut them
out!"</p>

<p>But the glasses did not uphold the prediction.
The machine with the black streamer was evidently
using the reserve power that had been claimed for
the newer make, and Henri was getting the best out
of it. Yet the first-born craft was being handled
in a masterly manner, had plenty of go to spare,
and five miles still rolled between the speeders and
the finish flag.</p>

<p>Now four, and the machines were bow and bow;
now three, and the yellow band flapped a few feet
behind the black; now two, now within the mile,
and the whirring of the motors audible to the nerve-strained
watchers below&mdash;then the close finish&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the white-faced pilot crowned victor was Billy
Barry of Bangor, U. S. A.!</p>

<p>When the aëroplanes made landing, Roque
pushed through the crowd and favored the Aëroplane
Scouts with a forcible slap between the shoulders.</p>

<p>The victors were quick enough to extend hands
to the vanquished.</p>

<p>"My friend," cried Billy, giving Fritz a warm
grip, "it was only fifty feet, and it was the new motors
that did it."</p>

<p>Then the crowd cheered, while the efficiency committee
agreed with Roque that "No. 3" was the
machine to be many times duplicated.</p>

<p>"That was something over a mile a minute coming
back, I guess," figured Billy.</p>

<p>"The fastest heavy craft I ever sailed in," was
Henri's expressed belief.</p>

<p>"I think you youngsters could make a living here
if I were to bounce you," said Roque, who had been
talking to some of the factory chiefs. "But you
are hooked to my train for a while yet. And that
reminds me that the mentioned train starts in the
direction of Austria in the next two hours. Vienna
is not a slow place, you will find."</p>

<p>As Roque was likely to jump anywhere at the
drop of a hat, the boys in his company had long
since lost the emotion of surprise.</p>

<p>Perpetual motion had become a habit with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Austrian capital the travelers encountered
many invalids from the front, men who limped
a little, had an arm in a sling, or a bandaged head.
The Viennese on the surface did not seem to be
greatly impressed by the tragedy of the war&mdash;evidently
becoming used to it&mdash;yet the determination
to fight to the finish, while not as grim as in Berlin,
was there, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Another thing that impressed the boys was that
here foreign terms were still much in evidence&mdash;French
and English. In Berlin it was different.</p>

<p>As Billy said, "we're in a better mixing town."
He and Henri were told that quite a number of
medical and art students from America had decided
that Vienna was safe enough for them, but Roque
kept his airmen close under his wing, and they had
no opportunity to pass even the time of day with
any of the U. S. A. crowd.</p>

<p>They had no present desire, however, to attempt
a bolt from Roque and did not believe, anyway,
that their detention was just then seriously affecting
their health.</p>

<p>"Time enough to run," was Billy's philosophy,
"when his nobs begins to kick in our ribs."</p>

<p>They were seeing plenty to keep them interested,
the arrival of sleeping-car trains bringing the
wounded to the capital, the movement of troops
bound for the Polish or Galician front, the daily
sights of the Ring and the Kartnerstrasse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Roque, as usual, was up to his eyes in war business,
ever behind the scenes but ever moving, for
there is close military coöperation between Germany
and Austria-Hungary. All interests related to the
war have been pooled&mdash;one empire gives to the
other what can be spared. The king-pin of secret
agents from Berlin served a purpose wherever he
went.</p>

<p>He sat in no open councils, but privately conducted
many of his own, was constantly receiving
and dispatching messages, and the devices he originated
to aid his disguised subordinates burrowing
for information in hostile territory were too numerous
for detail. These latter operations were not
accompanied by band music, for officially this live
wire had no identity.</p>

<p>"If that man took a pot shot at the ocean you
would never know in what direction he was aiming
unless you happened to see the splash." Billy was
not far from being right in the summing up of
Roque's methods.</p>

<p>Within the next hour the boys "happened to see
the splash."</p>

<p>A uniformed messenger handed Roque a telegram.
The secret agent hastily read it, and sprang
to his feet, his eyes aglow with triumphant satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I've got Mr. Ardelle in a stone box at last!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE RAIN OF BOMBS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys in silence watched the secret agent
as he further displayed his gratification over the
news conveyed in the telegram by snapping his fingers
and slapping his knees, completing the performance
by vigorous puffing of a big black cigar,
of which brand he always carried a plentiful supply.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were just aching to learn more
about the reported capture of Anglin (Ardelle),
just where the "stone box" that held him was located,
and how the "smiling sleuth" had happened
to run into a net that he could not break through.</p>

<p>But they were well aware that it would not be a
bit of use to seek the eagerly desired information
in advance of Roque's disposition to give it, and
they did not dare openly to show personal interest
in the matter.</p>

<p>It was not until the master plotter had burned
his cigar to inch measure that he thought to address
the lads, fixing expectant gaze upon him.</p>

<p>"They jugged the fox in Alsace, on the way to
his home den, and filled up, I suppose, with some
choice morsels to regale the enemy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe it's another case of 'now you see him
and now you don't.'" It was Henri who plucked
up courage to say this.</p>

<p>"Not this time," insisted Roque. "He is tightly
in the toils, and never a chance to show his cunning.
His course is run."</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the speaker proposed
to be "in at the death," as fox chasers call the finish.</p>

<p>In less than two hours Vienna, the city gay and
unafraid, was behind the three travelers, and their
next goal the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>Into Lower-Alsace, on the last leg of the journey,
Roque and the boys took to horse, with cavalry
escort. They were again on real fighting
ground.</p>

<p>Henri picked out of a conversation between
Roque and the captain of the troop the words
"Homberg castle," later that a group of important
German officers resided there, and still later that
within those walls Anglin was a prisoner.</p>

<p>Billy was immediately posted by his chum as to
the situation.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the castle, Roque, in that mysterious
but effective way of his, established his footing
as a privileged guest, and his first move was to
pass the guard at the door of the strong-room,
where his chief rival in the art peculiar was confined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys without reprimand were close at the
heels of the German agent.</p>

<p>Anglin was sitting on a bench, under the checkered
light of a high, barred window. While his
face showed harsh lines of great strain, the inevitable
smile was in his eyes. He arose instantly
from the bench, and bowed gracefully to the foe
who confronted him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you are welcome." This to Roque.
Upon the boys he bestowed not the slightest recognition.</p>

<p>Roque, not to be outgeneraled as a diplomat, inclined
his head in return.</p>

<p>"I came a long way to visit you, sir," he politely
stated, "and would have regretted had you felt otherwise
than you have intimated."</p>

<p>This fencing with buttons on the foils was soon
succeeded by the sharp points unprotected.</p>

<p>"Ardelle, the longer the breath is in you the more
you can tell; is the breath worth the telling?"</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles, Monsieur," quietly replied
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Do you deny that you are Ardelle?" demanded
Roque.</p>

<p>"Am I now on trial?" was the counter-question.</p>

<p>Roque extended a menacing finger. "Have a
care, man!" he thundered.</p>

<p>The prisoner calmly ignored the growing wrath
of his arch-enemy, shrugged his shoulders, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a wave of the hand indicated that continued argument
was useless.</p>

<p>"You will have until to-morrow morning to decide
whether you will accept me as an advocate or
an accuser."</p>

<p>The Frenchman turned wearily toward the window,
and with his hands folded behind him stood
watching through the bars the little gray cloudlets
pushing their way through the blue expanse of the
sky. It might be that this view would not concern
him after the morrow. He was thus engaged when
Roque stamped his way out of the room. Henri
would have paused in the hope of one look from
Anglin but the latter seemed wholly unconscious of
the presence of the lads.</p>

<p>Under the steely exterior of Roque, the milk of
human kindness had not wholly curdled, for he
sadly said, half to himself and half to his boy companions:</p>

<p>"He must expect no more than I could expect;
when we fail we fail alone, and so alone must we
suffer."</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock in the morning of the
day when Anglin, or Ardelle, was expected to read
his fate in the eyes of those assembled as a military
tribunal. The identity of the prisoner was, no
doubt, fully established, for the boys had noted
the presence in the assembly hall earlier in the
night of the sandy-topped man who had started the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hue and cry in the Bremen hotel, where the French
sleuth was posing as a public singer.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were tossing in uneasy slumber.
The only sounds inside the castle were occasional
snores from adjoining apartments and from the
outside the whinnying and stamping of the cavalry
horses.</p>

<p>Suddenly the quiet was shattered as if by a thunderbolt.
The boys literally tumbled out of bed,
gasping from the shock. A blinding flash at the
windows and another crash.</p>

<p>Soul-shaking cries of "fire!" resounded throughout
the building, and through the halls swept volumes
of smoke.</p>

<p>The celebrated ancient furniture in the castle,
it having been the summer residence of French nobility,
was fine food for flames, and the red destroyer
soon raged in conflagration.</p>

<p>Crash after crash, and with each concussion
myriad sparks shot through great holes in the castle
roof.</p>

<p>Bombs were being dropped from aloft.</p>

<p>The boys hastened with other occupants of the
upper floors to the broad staircase in front of the
structure. There they paused, elbowed against the
wall by those pressing from the rear. There was
no wild confusion or panic behind them, however,
such as might have ensued under the same terrifying
circumstances with other than trained soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
involved. When Billy and Henri took to the wall
at the head of the staircase it was a voluntary act
on their part. The same thought with both had
impelled the pause:</p>

<p>Had Anglin been released from the fiery vortex
or still restrained by iron bolts and bars?</p>

<p>The room in which the captive was held faced
a gallery running at right angles from the main
stairway.</p>

<p>Pulling their jackets up and over their heads, the
boys plunged through the wall of smoke on mission
of rescue&mdash;a mission without result, for the door
of the place of confinement was wide open, and no
one was there.</p>

<p>The rescuing party of two then turned their intent
upon themselves, and none too quickly, for they
had hardly won safety when the castle enclosure
was wholly enveloped by consuming flame.</p>

<p>Farm buildings adjoining were also ablaze, and
the wide highway stretching away to the east
showed whitely in the glare.</p>

<p>In the red canopy overhead winged shadows
whirred and whirled, dipped and leaped.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri proceeded down the road to
escape the growing heat and rolling smoke. When
the roaring of the fire had somewhat lessened in
their hearing, they detected a familiar hum, just
ahead and closing down beyond the border of the
rising mist of the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>As aviators, the boys were instantly aware that
an aëroplane was working near and the proof was
immediately furnished by the appearance of the
aircraft itself, swooping into the circle of illumination,
skimming close to the surface of the highway.</p>

<p>The lads sprang forward to greet the aërial visitor,
and as they did so a tall figure, hatless and
coatless, leaped from the cover of a ditch nearby,
ran like a deer alongside the skimming biplane, and
vaulted into the frame behind the daring navigator.</p>

<p>As the machine took the uplift, Billy and Henri
were so close, and the fire-flow so vivid, that they
plainly saw the faces of both the saver and the
saved.</p>

<p>The man who had jumped into the machine was
Anglin; the aviator was Gilbert Le Fane, the noted
airman of Rouen, whom our boys had once followed
in flight from Havre to Paris.</p>

<p>From the fire zone there was coming a hurrying
body of men, and rifles began to spit lead at the
swiftly rising aircraft. Too late, though, to reach
the height attained by the biplane. A shrill yell
of defiance floated back on the breeze of the morning,
and deep and heavy were the expressions of
baffled rage by those grouped in the road below.</p>

<p>Roque and the sandy-haired assistant could be
heard above all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were again in the rôle of innocent bystanders.</p>

<p>When the sun later replaced the flames in lighting
up the sky, not a trace of the French airmen could
be sighted, save the marks of their raid&mdash;the blackened
ruin of the castle and smouldering remains
of the adjoining buildings.</p>

<p>Investigation instituted by Roque related solely
to the escape of the prisoner. To put a quietus on
his rival had drawn him from afar, and here again
the elusive Frenchman had been jerked out of his
clutches, this time into the very sky.</p>

<p>With the fall of the first bomb the single night
guard over the captive had drawn the bolts that he
might be ready to quit his post upon first order with
the Frenchman in close custody. The second bomb
so stunned the guard that he knew no more until
regaining consciousness in the rear courtyard outside.
He could only account for his presence there
by the belief that the man over whom he had held
watch had picked him up and carried him out of
danger. There was a back way that could be traveled,
smoke hidden, without observation.</p>

<p>"But how about the aëroplanes dipping just at
the right time and place to carry him off?"</p>

<p>This was the point that especially puzzled Roque.</p>

<p>A farmer boy, listening, open-mouthed, to the
questioning, offered a solution.</p>

<p>"You see, Monsieur," he bashfully explained, "it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
was a ghostly noise that was making between the
big noises, like the wind blowing through the neck
of a bottle stuck in a knot hole. I heard it in the
road, a long way."</p>

<p>It occurred to the boys that this distress signal
must have been given before they got away from
the roar of the fire, or while they were probing the
smoke in the gallery to reach Anglin.</p>

<p>"They were flying mighty close down and could
probably hear a howl like that, if they were listening
for it and knew what it meant." This opinion
was advanced by Billy.</p>

<p>"I don't much believe they could hear a call from
the ground, unless it came from the business end of
a gun." Henri was the doubter.</p>

<p>"It is no use to argue," said Roque. "The fact
remains that the air fellow had his bearings, and
he got the lead from somewhere. I am not giving
him credit for being a mind reader."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Mr. Roque," remarked Billy,
"that we might test this bearing business by a little
air trip somewhere and soon."</p>

<p>"I have just such a thing in thought," grimly advised
Roque, "and I will warrant that you will
hear a few ground sounds before the quitting minute.
We are going to take a down look at Belfort."</p>

<p>Now Belfort is a French fortress, where the soldiers
in red and blue had been finding security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
every time they were rolled back from the plains of
upper Alsace.</p>

<p>A tremendous amount of gunpowder had been
burned on the flat ground in front of this stronghold,
and our boys were in for a smell of it&mdash;something
that would recall perilous travel with
Colonel Bainbridge and Sergeant Scott in previous
campaigns.</p>

<p>A wire to Friedrichshaven had started on the
way the makes of biplanes that Billy called
"Roque's best bet" since the day of the famous
race over Lake Constance.</p>

<p>"Business will soon be looking up," joked Henri,
when he heard of the order for the shipment of
"No. 3's."</p>

<p>The presence of Ardelle in this region, extreme
southwestern Germany, had raised suspicion in the
mind of Roque that some special demonstration
was brewing, and the lurid performance of the
French airmen in blowing the roof from over his
head served to further elevate the confirmed idea
that trouble and the French agent always traveled
together.</p>

<p>Roque was not here to mix in the actual military
operations&mdash;that was not his business, but he was
ever open-eyed on the trail of the boss gamester
on the other side. He had expected this time to
put his rival on the safe side of the ground, but
spades did not prove to be trumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhere in the gap of Belfort, as the valley
south of the Vosges mountains is popularly known,
Ardelle was, no doubt, preparing for another comeback,
and Roque was scheming to meet him halfway.</p>

<p>There was no chance to get under the guns of
the frowning fortress beyond the frontier, so the
only way to size up the situation was to go over
them.</p>

<p>Here was where flying experts jumped to the
front.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>ALONG THE BATTLE LINE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the arrival of the biplanes from the factory,
the Boy Aviators were kept busy with brief
test flights over valley and plain, awaiting the convenience
of Roque for the wider sweep he was planning.
It developed that the boys were expected to
navigate separately on this occasion, Billy to pilot
Roque himself, and Henri to be accompanied by one
Renos, who had been awarded a service badge of
honor for his work as an aërial observer in giving
first warning of the advance of a French division
against Burnhaupt, which saved the day for the
Germans.</p>

<p>"The seaplane is the rig for weight carrying,"
exclaimed Roque, in accounting for this assignment,
"but these machines, as you know, are solely
in the speed class, and it is many chances to one
that we will be compelled to tax every ounce of
power before we get through. So we have no use
for deadwood."</p>

<p>Renos, who was to sit behind Henri, was the
silent man of the expedition, as far as talking was
concerned, but when it came to be up and doing
he could be counted on to the limit. He was a human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
route-box of the Sundgau, the fighting territory,
and very much at home in a flying machine.
When the two machines one morning flew over the
German frontier, in compliance with the "ready"
order of Roque, Renos' knees were crossed by a
wicked-looking rifle, and of the party he was the
only one armed.</p>

<p>Billy, observing this war-like figure, asked Roque
if he expected to get into close quarters on this
trip.</p>

<p>"Not unless some of the bomb-throwing crowd
that scarred the landscape the other night should
cross our path," replied the secret agent.</p>

<p>As Renos was the qualified guide, the biplane
bearing him went to the front, and Henri received
overshoulder directions as to the course to be maintained.</p>

<p>The apparent reason why the German expert did
not pilot the craft himself was that he wanted a
loose hand in case of emergency, and a free eye
for the panorama below. He was satisfied, too,
that one as good as the best was doing the steering.</p>

<p>Henri was instructed to keep a respectful distance
from the near mountain peaks, where the
French had mounted artillery, for one round from
these guns, close enough, would have ended the
flight and the flyers there and then.</p>

<p>But Roque and Renos kept constant vigil with
glasses, and Billy wondered that the pair did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
get a crick in the neck with all the head-turning
they did.</p>

<p>A sharp order advised the pilots to send the biplanes
farther aloft, and circle. The French fortress
of Belfort could be seen directly underneath.</p>

<p>The aviators well knew that an explosion close
to an aëroplane is often sufficient, through the
force of the air concussion alone, to bring it down,
and they knew they could not chance a close shot
from the long-range guns in the fort.</p>

<p>Though the machines now evoluted at greater
height, the powerful glasses enabled the observers
to plainly distinguish the movements below.</p>

<p>It was quickly manifested that the garrison lookout
had become aware of the aërial visitation, and
that they did not approve of the color of the hovering
aircraft.</p>

<p>A couple of smokeballs ascended and burst in
the center of a cloudrack far to the right of the machine.
Renos broke his record for silence with a
shrill cackle.</p>

<p>"Save your powder, you numbskulls," he
shouted for his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>Roque seemed oblivious of the gunplay below.
As the biplane described great circles over the fort,
he kept his glasses steadily aimed at a point in the
enclosure over which the flag was floating.</p>

<p>The men who emerged from the officers' quarters
all wore the French uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Roque had evidently cleared up a disturbing
point in his mind as he muttered something about
a "fool story," and "I might have known there was
nothing to it."</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that it was still an independent
little war at this remote point from the
main field of operations, and that he had been misled
by some advices previously received, the chief
observer passed the word to his pilot to back-track,
at the same time giving signal to the companion biplane.</p>

<p>As the machines swung around for the return
flight, and drew closer together, Renos gave a
megaphone yell through a hollow formed by his
hands:</p>

<p>"Speed for your lives, they're on the wing!"</p>

<p>Above the gentle slopes on the west, leading to
the summit of the mountain ranges, aircraft had
arisen, looking, at a distance, like black dragonflies.</p>

<p>At the same moment, the invading biplanes also
had a reminder to hurry from the fortress they
were leaving behind.</p>

<p>A shell burst seemingly quite close to the machine
Henri was driving, and the craft dipped far
to one side.</p>

<p>Billy's heart beat up to his throat when he saw
the break in the flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>But his was an exulting cry when the momentarily
stricken flyer righted, and bored ahead.</p>

<p>"Glory be!" hoarsely rejoiced the boy from Bangor,
when his chum again drew to the upper level.</p>

<p>Seventy miles an hour was the clip of the fleeing
biplanes, and no less speedy the onrush of the
aircraft from the slopes.</p>

<p>"Steady, and a little to the right," Renos instructed
Henri.</p>

<p>The observer was resting the rifle barrel on the
rigging, awaiting a broadside target.</p>

<p>Sping! One of the attacking aviators was first
with his rifle, and the bullet nicked the armored
side of the German craft. Sput! Henri heard an
angry exclamation behind him, and shifted an eye
long enough to see that Renos was nursing a bloody
wrist on his knee.</p>

<p>"How hard are you hit?" was the anxious question
of the young pilot.</p>

<p>"Nothing to kill," replied the observer, as he
used his uninjured fingers and his teeth in knotting
a handkerchief above the wound so as to compress
the severed artery.</p>

<p>With the utmost calm he then deliberately used
his left hand in rifle aiming, and sent a bullet into
the nearest hostile machine.</p>

<p>Whether the shot crippled the pilot of the leading
pursuer, or whether it was the menace of the
heavy howitzers on the German frontier, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was now of short approach&mdash;the French flyers suddenly
ceased to be aggressive, and with a parting
salute of rifle practice, turned back toward their
mountain station, while the German machines
dashed across the line of safety.</p>

<p>Upon landing Billy indulged in a sort of war
dance around his chum.</p>

<p>"Thought you were gone that time, sure, Buddy,"
he cried, "and it was simply great the way
you pulled out of the hole."</p>

<p>"I guess I was stunned for a minute, as though
somebody had hit me with a hammer," explained
Henri, "but when I found the controls were still
working, it was a bracer, I tell you. And if there
isn't a cool head" (nodding toward Renos, who
was inspecting his wounded wrist) "I never saw
one. He stretched his arms over me ready to take
hold if I failed to rally, and did it as a matter of
course. Not a tremble about him, either."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the No. 3's now, boys?"
queried Roque, when he had dispatched Renos in
search of a surgeon.</p>

<p>"They're dandies, all right," promptly agreed the
happy pilots.</p>

<p>"They will do to hunt trouble with, anyhow,"
laughed the secret agent, who was immensely
pleased with the flying achievements of the day.</p>

<p>Roque, pluming himself with the idea that,
though he did not hold Ardelle when he had that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
artful dodger under his thumb, he had at least
chased his rival out of the empire; and, having
also eased his mind as to the report of a new element
in the Alsace campaign, he was impatient in
his preparation for departure. Master of detail
though he was, the big moves only appealed to him.</p>

<p>A great battle was raging at Soissons, on the
Aisne river, in France, and Roque had in mind
an aërial journey north, and quick flight across
the border to the scene of the fierce artillery duel,
following the line of march of the mighty force under
General von Kluck.</p>

<p>The crippled Renos was replaced in the observer's
perch by an aviator known as Schneider, a
very daredevil, and who was at first inclined to
doubt that the boy with whom he was paired had
sufficient skill and courage to pilot a military biplane
in an active war zone. Henri very quickly
convinced the doubter that he was very much older
than he looked when it came to the fine points of
aëroplaning, and, too, that when there was an
emergency demand for "sand" the youngster had
plenty to spare. Schneider had additional assurance
of capacity when he was advised that both
of the lads carried Roque's indorsement of efficiency.</p>

<p>It was a bitter struggle that the Aëroplane Scouts
were to witness at Soissons, and six days of it had
already passed. The earth was still dropping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
many graves of the German fallen, and yet, sprawling
in attitudes along the heights, in the deep-cut
gorges of the plateau, and across the flat valley bed
were French infantrymen in their far-to-be-seen
red-and-blue uniforms, swarthy-faced Turcos, colonials,
Alpine riflemen, and bearded territorials.</p>

<p>At staff headquarters, in the first officer that
passed near them the boys recognized a familiar
figure, no other than Colonel Muller, whom they
had first met in far-away Texas, U. S. A., on the
day of the record flight, and again in the hangar
camp at Hamburg.</p>

<p>Billy impulsively stepped forward. "How do
you do, Colonel?"</p>

<p>The officer instantly turned in his stride to inspect
the speaker. "Hello, Boy Aviator," was his
hearty greeting. "How under the sun did you ever
get here?"</p>

<p>"Same old way," said Billy, "the airline, of
course."</p>

<p>"And here's the other one," the colonel reaching
for Henri's shoulder.</p>

<p>"By the way," continued the big soldier, "this
must be a field day for flyers. Here, Hume, come
and see what the wind brought in."</p>

<p>The officer addressed moved at quickstep in response
to this invitation. It was the aviation lieutenant
from Hamburg. He grinned from ear to
ear when he laid eyes on his former charges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't lose you if I try," he exclaimed. "Have
you enlisted with us?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Billy, "we're still driving cars
for the good merchant from your town," with the
backward point of the thumb at Roque, who was
engaged in close confab with a group of staff members
near by.</p>

<p>"Did you blow in with Schneider, too?" asked
the lieutenant. "I just want to say that you will
bore a hole in a stone wall sometime if you train
with that fellow. Nature didn't give him red hair
without reason."</p>

<p>"Now that you are here," broke in the colonel,
"you must not be allowed to get out of practice.
I expect that one of you will have to give me a ride
along the front before long. I have lost three
horses this week."</p>

<p>"We'll do our best to oblige you, colonel," volunteered
Billy.</p>

<p>It was no merry jest, that ride Billy gave the
colonel!</p>

<p>At the time, the French retained a foothold
north of the river at only one point&mdash;St. Paul&mdash;where
the bridge from Soissons crosses, and this
by a perilous margin, since the bridgehead was
completely commanded by German artillery on the
heights.</p>

<p>The battlefield entire covered a front of about
seven miles, the center and eastern flank a high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
level plateau rising steeply a couple of hundred
feet from the valley of the Aisne. On the western
side a deep valley ran northward, bounded on either
side by turnpikes. An airman taking the big curve
of the river would not be considered a good risk for
a well-regulated insurance company.</p>

<p>But it could be done&mdash;and Billy Barry furnished
the proof.</p>

<p>When the next day broke a bloody conflict was
raging between the two turnpikes, the French infantry
attack on German trenches preceded by a
terrible artillery bombardment, a storm of shell
and shrapnel.</p>

<p>Colonel Muller beckoned Billy to his side. They
stood together on the heights from which the
French had been expelled only the day before.</p>

<p>"My boy," was the brisk address of the officer,
making a field-glass survey of the smoke-crowned
landscape, "I am going down the line, and I am
to do the distance in an aëroplane. Is it you or
Schneider who will do the driving?"</p>

<p>"You gave me the first call yesterday," reminded
Billy.</p>

<p>"That was my intent, and it still holds. I was
only seeking to learn if you were of the same mind
since that powder mill let loose down there."</p>

<p>"I well know the odor of it," stoutly maintained
Billy, "and it doesn't weaken my knees."</p>

<p>The young aviator, accepting the matter as settled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hastened toward staff headquarters. "Mr.
Roque," he excitedly called, "Colonel Muller wants
to try one of the No. 3's this morning, and I'm
to pilot."</p>

<p>The secret agent lifted his eyebrows as though
surprised, but he really was not. The arrangement
had already been made.</p>

<p>"Say, Buddy, this is rough that we can't both
go; and suppose something should happen to you?"
Henri had just realized that something was up, in
which his chum was vitally concerned.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, pard," consoled Billy, "it is
only a little spin of a few miles, and we'll be back
in no time."</p>

<p>"Wish it was me," sighed Schneider, for this firebrand
guessed that it would be a red-hot journey.</p>

<p>As the biplane swept into the breeze current,
trending to the river, which then was running brimful,
and in many places overflowing its banks between
the two armies, Colonel Muller advised Billy
to keep the machine climbing for the time being, as
a terrific fusillade was in progress in the distance of
the next two miles, the shells hurtling through the
air like lighted express trains. In the three steep-sided
ravines that deeply notched the plateau on
the east French troopers swarmed like bees, and at
this cover the big German guns were blindly banging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't see much, Colonel, at two thousand
feet," complained Billy.</p>

<p>"You would see nothing at all if we ran into
one of those fragments of shells," coolly suggested
the officer, "but never mind, you will do some diving
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Billy got the signal to dip at the juncture of the
turnpikes, and to hold a level and lower course
along the line of battle, marked here by infantry
fighting between the seemingly crawling columns
far below.</p>

<p>"Down!"</p>

<p>The colonel's order was peremptory, and Billy
forthwith volplaned toward the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE LUMINOUS KITE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> biplane had hardly scudded its length on
the turnpike, when the colonel leaped from the machine,
his sudden appearance greeted by salvos,
both of cheers and an extra round of rifle discharge.</p>

<p>Billy sat like a statue in the machine, facing a
reserve force of grim, gray-garbed veterans standing
at attention.</p>

<p>The front rank soldiers eyed the boy curiously,
no doubt wondering that one of his years should be
serving in the capacity of a full-fledged military
aviator on a mission so supremely perilous.</p>

<p>Billy could not understand what Colonel Muller
was saying to the commanding officer of this regiment,
but he could see the effects rippling through
the serried lines, a stiffening of attitude, a
closer grip of rifle stock and squaring of shoulders.</p>

<p>The column, solid and compact, the German practice
of close formation, moved with clockwork precision
down the field to back the general charge
against the living wall that barred the way.</p>

<p>"Charge! Charge!" The cry from a thousand
throats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The forces mixed in a struggling, swaying mass,
with indescribable noises, the clashing of steel and
the squealing of horses, for cavalry had joined the
fray.</p>

<p>Billy jumped out of the machine into the dusty
road, the sole spectator there of the conflict that
raged but a half mile distant.</p>

<p>Colonel Muller had taken to horse and was riding
furiously to rally incoming reinforcements for
the gray column.</p>

<p>A rattle cut into the sound ruck&mdash;the machine
guns of the Germans had turned loose, and men
were mowed down like ripened corn.</p>

<p>But fainter now in Billy's ears grew the roar of
violent contention, alternate advance and retreat
serving to shift the tide of battle further northward,
and finally stemmed by the final demonstration
of the day at Soissons bridge.</p>

<p>Barring the occasional wild gallop of a riderless
horse down the road, the young aviator saw no
signs of life about him, and he was too far away
to hear the groans of the wounded on the sodden
field now enfolded by the gathering gloom of evening.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the colonel has forgotten that his
carriage is waiting," thought Billy, trying a bit of
mental cheer to relieve the strain of his trying position.</p>

<p>The colonel, however, had not lost his memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
along with his hat, for even then a foam-flecked
horse was bringing him back to the driver of his
aërial chariot. Mud-bespattered from head to foot,
he sent a hearty hail ahead of the pounding hoofs
of his weary mount.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, my stranded mariner: is supper ready?"</p>

<p>That reminded Billy of a decided vacancy under
his belt, but the glad sight of the colonel was the
best tonic for a drooping spirit.</p>

<p>"We will wheel this airship out of the way for
a spell and have a bite to eat in the trenches."</p>

<p>Concealing the biplane behind a clump of bushes
the colonel gave Billy a hand-up, and the horse cantered
away with its double burden in the direction
of the slopes.</p>

<p>It was about 7:30 when the colonel and Billy
climbed over the slippery slopes to the line of reserve
trenches, lowered themselves into one of these
holes in the ground, and it was evident that the occupants
knew how to convert a ditch into a home.</p>

<p>This trench had a head cover formed of cross-beams,
overlaid with branches and earth&mdash;a sure
protection against shrapnel. There was a long
bench of telegraph poles, little cupboards for cartridges
and kit, and ramps for reclining chairs or
couches, and drains to carry off the rain.</p>

<p>"Come into our parlor, colonel," invited one of
the soldiers, leading the way into a subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
chamber, which was warmed by a fire in an old perforated
petroleum tin.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful what ingenuity and labor can
accomplish out of the most unpromising material,"
observed the colonel.</p>

<p>"Made in Germany, colonel," laughed one of the
veterans, "no matter where you put them."</p>

<p>From the business end of the trench a hot meal
was speedily produced for the visitors, adding another
touch of surprise for Billy.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, we must report to the general,"
announced the colonel, who had politely denied the
petition of the trench veterans that he try one of
their couches for the night.</p>

<p>"You don't mind an air trip in the dark, do you?"
inquired the colonel.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," assured Billy, "I've made many a
one."</p>

<p>It was quite pitch black when the colonel and
Billy rode back across the plain, but the horse was
sure-footed, and the way was fitfully lighted by
the occasional upshoot of rockets that left a long
green stream of stars, revealing the now silent battlefield
and its dreadful record of uncounted dead.</p>

<p>While Billy flourished an electric torch in giving
the biplane a careful look over, the colonel bestowed
a playful slap on the flank of the faithful horse,
which sent the animal trotting up the road.</p>

<p>"He knows his number and troop as well as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
do, and will go as straight as a die to the feed
trough," asserted the colonel.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, boy?"</p>

<p>"Trim as a ship, colonel."</p>

<p>With a flare on the compass, rising high, Billy
held the nose of the biplane in the direction of the
heights that centered headquarters.</p>

<p>Small red sparks glowed in the trenches below,
and the upper darkness was ever and anon split
by signal rockets and leaping flames of light from
countless campfires.</p>

<p>Billy, with the aid of the small searchlight in the
bow of the biplane, found safe landing, also insuring
a sight of the colors to the sentries, who might
otherwise be tempted to take a pot shot at the
winged, midnight visitor.</p>

<p>Henri was the first to hear the whirr of the incoming
aircraft, for which he had for hours held
an open ear.</p>

<p>"Here you are at last!" he exclaimed, making an
open-arm break for his flying partner. "You
haven't lost an eye, or a leg, or anything, have
you?" he anxiously inquired.</p>

<p>"Sound as an Uncle Sam dollar, old boy," assured
Billy. "But you just bet I'm sleepy."</p>

<p>"I believe even Roque was uneasy about you,"
said Henri, as he insisted on giving Billy's blanket
a snug tug.</p>

<p>That the secret agent proposed to reserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
services of the young aviators to himself thereafter
and during their stay in this locality was made
manifest when he told them the next day to make
ready for a quick departure in the biplanes. As
usual, he furnished no advance particulars.</p>

<p>It appeared that Schneider was also to figure in
the expedition in a capacity indicated by his employment
of oiling and polishing a service rifle of
the 16-shot brand, and the display of a pair of
long-barreled revolvers stuck in his belt.</p>

<p>"He looks like an arsenal on parade," commented
Billy when the red-haired flyer, in war-like array,
passed on the way to conference with Roque.</p>

<p>"There is no peaceful intent about that get-up,"
admitted Henri. "And let me make another prediction,"
he continued, still proud of his last previous
success as a prophet, "this isn't going to be
any pink tea or garden party to which we're going."</p>

<p>"What a head you have," said Billy, beaming
with mock admiration.</p>

<p>There was a decided lull in the fighting this day&mdash;the
ninth since the continuous combat had been
commenced, as the soldiers of the two armies were
apparently resting on their arms. Some fresh
planning, no doubt, was in progress.</p>

<p>The boys wandered around the camp, restlessly
anticipating the expected summons from Roque.
The latter, however, had not picked daylight in
which to operate, for it was long past nightfall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
when Schneider sought and advised the boys that
the starting time had arrived.</p>

<p>The moon was working full time when the biplanes
set their course, following the turnpike toward
La Fere.</p>

<p>Above a farm, which had practically been razed,
and on the edge of a ruined district, both Roque
and Schneider signaled the pilots to lower the flight,
and the biplanes circled groundward, landing near a
row of stunted willow trees. They showed no
lights, and with the motors silenced lay hidden behind
a huge pile of debris, close to a wrecked dwelling,
so close that the full moon shining through
the shattered roof gave the aviators a dim vision
of hopeless confusion, cooking pots and children's
toys, broken clocks and tables, knives, forks and
books strewn on the floor, beds and everything
awry.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri had as yet no inkling of the purpose
of this mysterious proceeding in which they
were engaged. Their companions did not seem to
be in a hurry, either, to enlighten them. Roque
and Schneider appeared intent in upward gaze, perhaps
hoping that the moon and a dense bank of
clouds forming near would soon come together.
As a matter of fact, a total eclipse of the great
orb above did follow, with the effect of the sudden
blowing out of the one lamp in an otherwise dark
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Curious to relate, it was not long until the moon
was replaced in the now black canopy by a small
but quite silvery brilliant imitation of the big illuminant.</p>

<p>The diamond-shaped light in the lowering sky
flashed this way and that, as if responding to the
manipulation of an aërial cable.</p>

<p>Roque was not puzzling about the appearance
of the dancing light; it was the message that it
conveyed which baffled him, sent, as it were, from
within the German lines, and, maybe, of vital concern&mdash;aid
and comfort to the enemy.</p>

<p>Sentries on the heights had reported night after
night of this queer, intermittent flashing in this
very place, and when Roque heard of it, he instantly
comprehended the meaning.</p>

<p>Some spy within the lines was using a luminous
kite to signal information of value to the foe.</p>

<p>This is what had brought the secret agent, an
adept in the same kind of game, flying through the
night to scotch the play and the player.</p>

<p>Roque and Schneider skirted the ruins, and stumbled
over the plowed ground with all the haste that
such rough going permitted. The boys, free of
any order to stay where they were, cautiously
brought the rear. They were mighty curious to see
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>Schneider had taken the electric torch from under
the pilot's seat in one of the biplanes, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had occurred to Billy to follow suit. This precaution
served to save the party an ugly tumble or
two into forbidding ditches.</p>

<p>The still-hunters had just emerged into a road
with a wonderful avenue of trees. The kite telegrapher's
hidden nest was near at hand. The position
of the kite itself indicated that.</p>

<p>A streak of moonlight breaking through a cloud-rift
revealed Roque and Schneider kneeling in the
road, and there was a glint of a leveled rifle barrel.</p>

<p>The boys backed up against a tree, expecting
momentarily to hear the whip-like crack of the
gun. But instead came the bark of a dog&mdash;one
shrill yelp, then silence again.</p>

<p>The luminous kite, unleashed, followed the moon
into the clouds. Roque and Schneider dashed forward,
but for nothing else than to use the electric
torch in locating a half-loaf of bread, some cheese
crumbs and a ball of cord.</p>

<p>The sentry dog had saved its master!</p>

<p>"Nothing to be gained in chasing that fox to-night,"
growled Roque. "He's deep in the brush
before this."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have got a pop at the dog, at least,"
complained Schneider, patting the stock of his rifle.</p>

<p>The boys having no desire to be the victims of
any mistake of identity, marched forward, Billy
waving the electric torch, and calling to Roque:</p>

<p>"It's us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The passwords were unnecessary, for Roque
knew all the time the boys were trailing him, but
was restrained from objecting by fear of some
word reaching the ear of the man they were
stalking.</p>

<p>"You gadabouts," he admonished, "you should
have been guarding the biplanes instead of prowling
around in the dark like this."</p>

<p>The tone of the reprimand, however, was not
one of great severity. The boys had disobeyed no
order, for none had been given.</p>

<p>"As soon as day breaks," said Roque, as they
plodded wearily down the road, "we will continue
the hunt in the machines, though I doubt very much
whether it will amount to more than a waste of
time."</p>

<p>"If I see a man with a dog underneath us, just
bring me within rifle shot, young man, and I will
show you something fancy in the way of gunning."</p>

<p>Henri, whom Schneider was addressing, mentally
resolved that he would be in no haste to perform
as suggested.</p>

<p>Conditions, however, were reversed long before
this test could be made. Indeed, the reversal, with
the dawn, was at hand. The hunters were the
hunted.</p>

<p>The thud of iron-shod hoofs, the clank of sabers&mdash;a
troop of cavalry charging through the wooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
avenue&mdash;four madly racing footmen in the furrowed
field.</p>

<p>Full two hundred yards between them and the
biplanes!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>THE CARRIER PIGEONS.</small></h2>


<p>Billy and Henri, with much less weight to carry
than their stalwart fellow fugitives, and much
spryer as sprinters, easily led in the race to the
flying machines.</p>

<p>Schneider stopped more than once in his tracks
to fire from the hip at the pursuing cavalrymen, but
he failed to score a hit until the leader of the troopers
had almost ridden him down. One of the long-barreled
revolvers emptied the saddle of the rearing
charger. Schneider had thrown his rifle away
at the last moment, finding his pistol more effective
in close quarters.</p>

<p>By this time, the boys, assisted by Roque, who
was doing some shooting himself, until all of the
cartridges in the revolvers he carried were exploded,
had pushed and dragged the biplanes into the road,
and ready for the getaway.</p>

<p>Schneider, with a yell, hurled the empty revolvers
in the direction of the next comer, then bounded
across the first ditch in his way, jammed a shoulder
against the now humming machine in which
Henri was seated, to give it starting impetus, and
at the same instant leaped within the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Both machines were off in a jiffy, and when the
cavalrymen in force galloped to the spot, their carbines
fell short of range. That they had been
chasing airmen was something of a surprise for
if they had not been so sure of a capture, the troopers
would probably have pumped lead much earlier
in the chase.</p>

<p>"Guess he didn't get his man for keeps," remarked
Billy to Roque, as a side turn of the aircraft
enabled him to look down on the field, where
a dismounted rider was getting a helping hand
up from a comrade.</p>

<p>"Schneider gave him something to remember,
anyhow," grimly replied Roque.</p>

<p>In the other machine the red-topped and red-tempered
aviator in the observer's seat was deeply deploring,
in no uncertain terms, the loss of a crack-a-jack
rifle and two up-to-date revolvers, borrowed
for the occasion.</p>

<p>"Hume may toss earth when I tell him his pet
irons are gone, but it was a shindy for quick action,
and no saving grace."</p>

<p>Schneider evidently intended to tell the aviation
lieutenant about the fight before he mentioned the
missing weapons.</p>

<p>The next flight planned by Roque was one of long
distance&mdash;starting twenty-four hours later, and
leaving France.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my young friends, and good luck to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
you; if you ever see Colonel McCready again tell
him 'here's looking at him.'"</p>

<p>These were the parting words of Colonel Muller,
accompanied by a warm hand-grip.</p>

<p>When the flying party finally reached Strassburg,
the big German city of the Alsace-Lorraine
region, it was a glad day of halting.</p>

<p>They had floated in over a country literally shot
to pieces by the concentrated fire of the French
and German guns&mdash;that is, in French Lorraine&mdash;and
in the distance viewed the great fortress of
Metz. To the aviators it appeared as though the
land hereabouts had been devastated by a gigantic
earthquake, which had shaken down all the towns
and villages into a mass of shapeless, smoke-blackened
ruins.</p>

<p>The boys wondered that they did not see more
soldiers in the open, and Henri expressed this wonder
to his companion in the biplane.</p>

<p>"Oh, but the woods are full of them," assured
Schneider, pointing to the small columns of smoke
rising here and there from the snow-clad forests.</p>

<p>True it was that these same woods contained
thousands and thousands of armed warriors, ever
on the lookout, who were gazing across the frontier
at the other woods, which concealed countless
thousands of soldiers of the Kaiser.</p>

<p>In Strassburg, Roque was again in touch with
the invisible strands of the far-spreading web he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
maintained. Among his first advices was the most
disturbing one that Ardelle had returned and had
been making some ten-strikes within the borders of
the empire.</p>

<p>The boys shrewdly guessed that something of the
sort had happened from the renewal of the German
agent's habit of charging almost every sort of
disaster to the secret work of his French rival.</p>

<p>Roque realized, as one of the profession, what
an important factor is the under-cover man who
works within the enemy's lines in the service of
his country. And with a keen blade like Ardelle,
big things were possible, as past performances indicated.</p>

<p>But even Henri, as a self-claimed prophet, had
no idea that the man he knew as Anglin would bob
up in Strassburg, though the city was as likely a
point as any in the war zone for secret service
activity.</p>

<p>When Billy jokingly asked his chum if he had
any predictions to fit this occasion, Henri admitted
that his second-sight "was off the job."</p>

<p>It soon developed that the secret service experts
of both sides were matching wits in this quarter.
Reported in Roque's calendar of the week
was the giving away by one of his workers in hostile
territory of a French attack on the Germans
during a fog, with the result that the intended
surprise resulted in a rout, and the assailing force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
mowed down almost to a man. The mute testimony
was in a low-lying valley out in the Lorraine
field&mdash;700 graves in a space 200 yards wide and
about 50 broad.</p>

<p>Then a counter-move, wherein the French had
advices from some source unknown of the coming
flight of a Zeppelin out of the Black Forest, and
three French aëroplanes were ready to charge at
the big dirigible, which, after a continuous exchange
of fire lasting forty minutes, made narrow
escape to the north, just when the lighter craft
had succeeded in getting above it for a finishing
stroke.</p>

<p>As it came about, and in a queer way, too, the
boys were the first to blunder upon a cunning ruse
being resorted to by a smooth worker in getting
away information under the very nose of the astute
Roque.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, indulging their liking for high
places, and having a little leisure to look around,
found a favorite perch in one of the famous towers
of Strassburg. They were interested, as airmen,
in watching the daily flying exhibit of the
pigeons 'round about.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed, Henri, the streak of feathers
every once in a while that don't stop to associate
with this housekeeping bunch? I've seen two of
these birds already this morning; they act just like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
an aëroplane, circle about, and then break away
like a bullet. There's one now. Look!"</p>

<p>Henri followed the aim of Billy's finger, and,
sure enough, a long-tailed flyer was cutting the air
like greased lightning in a straight line west, without
the slightest notice of the many of its kind
pluming themselves on neighboring towers and
housetops.</p>

<p>"They make long visits," commented Billy; "I've
watched, but never see any of these air hustlers
come back."</p>

<p>"That's funny," observed Henri, "let's borrow a
glass this afternoon and find out, if we can, where
they start from. Why, this is good sport; we'll
be wearing badges next as pigeon detectives."</p>

<p>The boys had small notion then that they were
butting into a real business proposition, but one
that did not advertise!</p>

<p>They were just curious to find out from where
came the busy birds that would not take time to
visit with their brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The most that the tower observers could discover,
even with the field glasses, borrowed without leave
from Roque's traveling outfit, was that the next
bird comer took its bearings over a red-roofed
building, rising out of a circle of tall trees, a full
mile to the east.</p>

<p>Had it so happened that Roque was in a social
mood, and the boys making him a confidant of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bird study diversion, there would, without doubt,
have been no delay in striking at the heart of the
problem&mdash;and everything else under that red roof.</p>

<p>Carrier pigeons were not beneath the notice of
the big man with the delicate touch!</p>

<p>But Roque was not inclined at the time to indulge
in fireside fancies. He was hooked up to a procession
of events that needed constant attention, and
as it was all ground work for the present, he had
no use for aviators.</p>

<p>So he missed the first bang at the very musser-up
of his plans whom he was, day and night, seeking
to locate.</p>

<p>"We'll amble out that way to-morrow and learn
how to break pigeons of the loafing habit."</p>

<p>Billy had once had a loft full of pouters in Bangor,
that, he claimed, ate their breakfast in bed!</p>

<p>"We'll shake Schneider and start early."</p>

<p>Schneider had been detailed by Roque to keep
an eye on the boys, but Henri felt sure that this
firebrand would not be interested in pigeons, save
in a potpie, so he suggested the "shaking" process.</p>

<p>Trained in the sense of location by their aviation
experience, the boys proceeded without difficulty
to the sparsely settled neighborhood of the
red-roof, which they found to be in the center of
a neglected garden, overgrown with weeds.</p>

<p>"Don't see any pigeon loft yet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Having been a fancier himself, Billy knew how
the birds were housed.</p>

<p>"You might also say that you don't see any
pigeons," added Henri. "We've surely run by the
station."</p>

<p>"Not on a little excursion like this," maintained
Billy. "This is no ghost story."</p>

<p>With the words he led the way up the long gravel
walk extending from the rusty iron gate to the
front of the house.</p>

<p>"What will we tell them?" he asked, reaching for
the brass knocker on the dingy door of the dwelling.</p>

<p>"How will it do to say we are from the gas
office?"</p>

<p>"A fool answer fits a fool's errand," agreed Billy
as he gave the knocker a sounding rap.</p>

<p>The pounding awakened no sign of life.</p>

<p>"Come on, Billy," urged Henri, "let's go. It's
all a crazy move, anyhow, and it was just because
we were idle that we ever thought of it."</p>

<p>"I'm going to try the back door," insisted Billy,
"and then we'll quit."</p>

<p>There they got a response, probably after an advance
inspection. The door was partly opened by
a bent, palsy-shaken old man, who in quavering,
high-pitched voice inquired their business. The
question was in French, and Henri responded:</p>

<p>"We just came out to look at your pigeons, and"&mdash;the
age fell from the figure in the doorway in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the twinkling of an eye, two long arms shot out,
and in steely grip the astonished visitors were
jerked inside, the door closing with a slam behind
them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" gasped Billy,
whose collar had been given a tight twist by quick-grasping,
sinewy fingers.</p>

<p>Another violent wrench of the neck-joint was
the rude form of answer. Billy's fighting blood
took fire, and he launched a kick at his tormentor
which sent the latter spinning, doubled-up, clear
across the entrance hall.</p>

<p>The jarred one, recovering his breath, leaped like
a panther at the Bangor boy, but Henri gave him
the tripping foot, and he measured his length on
the dusty floor.</p>

<p>The boys were making a break for the door,
when a new figure blocked the way, suddenly
emerging from a room nearby&mdash;a resolute fellow,
with a cold, gray stare, backing up a steadily leveled
revolver.</p>

<p>"Been stirring up the monkeys, have you, Fred?"</p>

<p>The fallen man raised himself on his elbow and
made the air blue for a moment with his wrathful
expressions.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you, you whelps," glaring at the sturdy
youngsters who had bested him.</p>

<p>"Stow the threats, Fred," advised the cool-head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
who had restored the pistol to his hip-pocket when
he sized up the invaders as unarmed.</p>

<p>"What the devil brought you here?"</p>

<p>The newcomer put a snap in the question, but
with no change of icy eye.</p>

<p>"What devil sent them here, you'd better ask?"</p>

<p>This suggestion from the battered Fred, who had
again regained his feet.</p>

<p>"That will all come out under pressure," intimated
the cool one. "As long as you chose to
honor us with a visit," he added with quiet irony,
"we must get properly acquainted. Show the young
gentlemen into the parlor, Fred."</p>

<p>Billy would have started a debate there and then
had he not been, as usual, stumped by the French
language, which he only understood by fits and
starts. He knew for sure, though, that he was in
Queer Street, with this sudden shift from the regulation
German talk he had been hearing since landing
in the empire. It was up to Henri to set matters
straight.</p>

<p>Henri, however, had come to the conclusion that
the pigeon story was not popular here, considering
its effect on the man who had first met them at the
door. So he wore a thinking cap on the way to
the "parlor."</p>

<p>This apartment was the only one that had a
living look, all the others, noted in the passing,
cheerless and empty. It was a "sky parlor," being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
reached by narrow stairway, only a garret between
it and the roof.</p>

<p>An old table, rickety chairs, portable cots and a
rusty oil stove were in evidence. There was a wide
fireplace with no fire in it. It occurred to Henri
that the present occupants of the house did not
approve of smoking chimneys.</p>

<p>To get a line on what might be expected, he
mildly inquired, with a pale smile:</p>

<p>"Now that we are here, for what are we here?"</p>

<p>He was certain that he himself could not win a
prize with the correct answer.</p>

<p>The cold-eyed man could not restrain a short
laugh in his throat.</p>

<p>"You are the fellow on the witness stand," he
said, "but we must wait for the prosecuting attorney
to help us along."</p>

<p>In the waiting time the boys could hear through
an open trap-door above them the fluttering and cooing
of a score or more slate-colored doves, and it
had just dawned upon Billy that there was some
particular use for the sheets of oiled tissue and
skeins of pack-thread that littered the table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>UNDER THE RED ROOF.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were no additions to the party in the "sky
parlor" until after candlelight. The man called
Fred was half-asleep on one of the cots, when suddenly
aroused by repeated knocking below. He
made stealthy descent, listened at the entrance for
a moment, and apparently satisfied with the signal
conveyed in the rapping outside, cautiously unbarred
and opened the door. The person admitted
did not come empty handed, for when he stepped
from the stair-landing into the upper room he, and
likewise Fred, were carrying market-baskets of
goodly size.</p>

<p>"Hello, Gervais," was the hearty greeting he
gave to the cool one, the latter engaged, with a
well-thumbed deck of cards, in a game of solitaire.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," returned the gamester, dropping
the cards, and coming forward to relieve the
newcomer of the market basket.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were seated in the shadow, beyond
the range of the candle rays, and at the time
escaped notice. Both had started, however, at the
first sound of the new voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>From a side view the make-up was that of a typical
huckster of these parts, fur cap, with ear lappets,
corduroy greatcoat and cowhide boots. Between
cap and collar bunched a heavy growth of
iron-gray whiskers.</p>

<p>The boys did not realize that their instinctive
move, occasioned by a certain tone in the voice,
had not been amiss until the speaker had turned
full face.</p>

<p>Even the luxuriant whiskers could not wholly
hide the Anglin smile!</p>

<p>Much to the astonishment of Gervais and Fred,
and infinitely more to the surprise of the imitation
huckster, the boys at a single bound jointly invaded
the circle of light and grasped the elbows of their
one-time Calais acquaintance.</p>

<p>"What sort of a hold-up is this?" cried Anglin,
in startled recognition; "is it raining harumscarum
aviators in Strassburg? By the great horn spoon,
it's enough to make me believe I've got 'em to see
you under this roof."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you knew that we blew in with Roque,"
proposed Billy, "for you have a way of seeing
seven ways for Sunday."</p>

<p>"You win, laddy-buck, on the first statement, but
I'm still up a stump on the proposition of how
you got into this house."</p>

<p>"We were loafing," put in Henri, "started out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a pigeon hunt and got the drag when we mentioned
it at your back door."</p>

<p>"Pigeon hunt?" Anglin wore a puzzled look.</p>

<p>Henri made quick explanation of the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Ha! I see," exclaimed Anglin. "By the way,
you did not happen to mention your tower observations
to anyone else, did you?"</p>

<p>This last query had a dead-earnest ring, with
a rising note of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," assured Henri; "in the first
place, the big chief had no time to bother with us;
we had no inducement to talk to anybody else, and,
all in all, who'd have cared about the bird business,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems there was one fellow who did."</p>

<p>Billy indicated Fred, who was unpacking the
baskets.</p>

<p>"There are others," laughed Anglin, much relieved
by the boys' statement. Fur cap, wig and
false whiskers were tossed onto the mantelpiece,
and the huckster was no more.</p>

<p>The baskets had produced a plentiful supply of
ham, cold chicken, and the like, and not one of the
party could be charged with lack of appetite.</p>

<p>In the glow of good-fellowship, Fred told Billy
he was sorry that he had given him so rough a
reception.</p>

<p>"Honors are easy, old top," was Billy's jovial acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the apology, "and I am glad now that
we did not break any of your ribs when we banged
you around."</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Anglin, I am afraid, after all, that we
may bring down trouble on your head. I just know
that Roque will be in a great stew when he finds we
are gone and will fairly comb the town to locate
us."</p>

<p>The idea had begun to trouble Henri to the extent
of spoiling the pleasure of this reunion and indoor
picnic.</p>

<p>"I have thought of this," admitted Anglin, "but
the danger of discovery is ever the same, and I
don't believe this will either hurry or lessen it. Besides,
we are prepared, or, rather, had the way prepared
for us, to make a run on the slightest warning."</p>

<p>This restored to Henri happier thoughts, though
he still held belief that Anglin might have been safer
if Roque had no special inducement to immediately
lead a searching party throughout the city.</p>

<p>That is just what happened, and it proved not
an overly-difficult task for the keen tracker to trace
the boys to at least the vicinity of the place where
they were hidden.</p>

<p>The men under the red roof were soon made
aware of the lurking danger by the tooting of an
automobile horn in the avenue bordering the
grounds north of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a telegraph code set in shrill notes, and
it was apparent that Gervais, in alert listening attitude,
had comprehended the message, even as the
motor-car sounded the final blast in its swift passage
out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>The cool one, in most deliberate way, drawled
the words: "Look out."</p>

<p>As effective as if a whole dictionary had been
pumped through the window by Anglin's scouts.</p>

<p>The chief calmly resumed the disguise of wig
and whiskers, while Fred blew out half-a-dozen
candles with little waste of breath. With one tallow
dip still alight, and shaded by hand, the doorman
then mounted the ladder leading to the garret,
thereby causing up there great commotion in the
pigeon roost.</p>

<p>When Fred reappeared at the foot of the ladder,
it could be dimly seen, he wore a broad grin and
a wreath of cobwebs.</p>

<p>"When that flock arrives, empty-footed, old Winkelman
will swear like a pirate."</p>

<p>Fred had turned every carrier bird but one loose
in the night. The exception was fluttering in his
hand, blinking its beady eyes at the glimmer of the
lone candle.</p>

<p>Anglin had seated himself at the table and was
writing a few words on a scrap of parchment, completing
which he deftly attached the tiny roll to
the pink leg of the feathered envoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Fred lifted the window a few inches and released
the bird.</p>

<p>With the utmost care every bit of paper, every
inch of thread was picked up and stowed away in
the pockets of the three men preparing to vacate.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were busily figuring in their
minds just how they were going to come out of the
scrape, when the creak of a shutter, under prying
force, was heard on the lower floor.</p>

<p>"They're here at last," muttered Gervais, dropping
a hand to his hip, on the revolver side.</p>

<p>Anglin laid a finger on his lips, enjoining silence,
and tiptoed down the stairway, the others following
in shadowy procession.</p>

<p>On the first floor the leader paused. The attempt
to force the firmly hooked shutter had ceased, and
no new form of attack was for the moment in evidence.
Anglin had removed his cowhide boots,
and, with velvet tread, then advanced the entire
length of the long hall, motioning those behind him
to remain where they were.</p>

<p>He was back again in less than five minutes, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"The house, I believe, is completely surrounded.
They are waiting for daylight, I suppose, to cinch
some sure thing, the nature of which they are not
quite certain. If Roque is along and thought I was
inside, axes would have been working before this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will find a lot here at daylight," chuckled
Fred&mdash;"a lot of dust."</p>

<p>The party silently made their way through a
side passage to what appeared to have been intended
as the dining and cooking domain. Gervais
had assumed the duties of guide, and he showed
thorough acquaintance with the premises by first
producing a dark lantern from a cupboard, and then
moving directly to the black mouth of a steeply inclined
flight of stone steps descending far below
the level.</p>

<p>The spacious cellar was divided into sections by
partitions of solid brick. But it was at the center
of the foundation wall on the west where Gervais
halted.</p>

<p>"Give me a leg up."</p>

<p>Fred gave his comrade the required lift, and
Gervais secured a hand-grip on a big drain pipe
that curved into the wall. He gave the pipe a
strong-arm-twist, and the bull's-eye shine of the
lantern revealed an aperture in the masonry, into
which the climber squirmed.</p>

<p>Hardly had his feet disappeared, when he had
turned about with his head out of the hole in the
wall and a hand down to help the next comer to
scale the space between the floor and the dislocated
pipe.</p>

<p>Billy was given the hoist and crawled over the
prostrate Gervais into the narrow passage above;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Henri quickly followed, then Anglin, and finally
Fred, who lent aid in pulling the pipe back to its
moorings.</p>

<p>"'Snug as a bug in a rug,'" quoted Billy, who
was really enjoying this method of getting out of
a tight place, even though getting into another.</p>

<p>However, the rounded and cemented passage did
not squeeze enough to be uncomfortable, and there
was steady draught of fresh air coming from somewhere
further ahead.</p>

<p>"The good man from whom you leased this property
six months ago hardly counted this as one of
the improvements you agreed to make," remarked
Anglin as they started to wriggle through the drain.</p>

<p>Gervais laughed. "I didn't do anything to the
pipe but what had to be done, and 'a stitch in time
saves nine.'"</p>

<p>"It is likely to save three that I know of,"
grunted Fred.</p>

<p>"You can always count on Gervais to think for
the future."</p>

<p>The man so complimented by his chief said nothing,
saving his energy for the vigorous use of hands
and knees necessary to make progress in the smooth
channel.</p>

<p>The journey on all fours ended at a heavy grating,
through which faint daylight was peeping.
Through the barred opening the outlook was into
a deep ravine, with a small stream coursing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bottom, and a dense growth of small timber and
bushes rising to the level on all sides.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the entrance of the drain, in a
small clearing on the high ground across the gully,
the broad windows of a stone cottage reflected
the glare of the slowly rising sun.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else to do, my friends, but
to lay low until brother Roque completes the scouring
of this section. We are well on the way but
not yet out of the woods, as the saying is."</p>

<p>This was the view of the chief, and his views
were seldom questioned.</p>

<p>It was a rather gloomy prospect, this crouching
wait in quarters so confined, but the secret service
men counted nothing a hardship, and the boys had
to possess themselves in patience.</p>

<p>The capacious pockets of the huckster's greatcoat,
with which Anglin had not parted, despite
its weight, in the long crawl, contained a supply
of food, taken from the baskets before starting.</p>

<p>From the avenue that lay between the ravine
and the grounds about the house which they had
recently quitted, the cramped company in the drain
could hear the rumble of traffic, and once they heard
voices in close proximity to their hiding place.</p>

<p>"Giving them something to puzzle about, eh,
Gervais?"</p>

<p>"Rather a fuddle for them, chief," agreed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cool one, "and the best of it all, they don't know
whom they're after, unless it be these youngsters."</p>

<p>"Oh, I propose that the boys shall be found in
due time, but the balance of us will keep dodging
to the best of our ability."</p>

<p>"Some ability, too, believe me, boss," was Billy's
contribution.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe we can hold our own," complacently
observed Fred.</p>

<p>With the wearing of the long day, the prospect
of liberation eased the trial of the later hours. As
night fell apace, the first greeting to it was the glow
of a lamp in one of the windows of the stone cottage.</p>

<p>Gervais moved close to the grating, and fixed intent
gaze upon this illumination. In the course
of a half-hour his vigilance was rewarded by a sight
that he evidently anticipated. Somebody was repeatedly
crossing and recrossing the patch of light,
now and then deliberately standing in front of the
lamp. That "somebody" was making dots and
dashes as plain as day to the trained vision of the
receiving expert.</p>

<p>"The coast is clear," he announced.</p>

<p>A little pressure and the bars were down.</p>

<p>Out into the night crept the weary five, with
the luxurious experience of once more standing
erect and having a good stretch.</p>

<p>Having replaced the grating in the drain entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to a nicety, Gervais led the way down the steep
slope of the ravine to the creek, which Billy and
Henri attempted to drink dry, so great was their
thirst.</p>

<p>"Now is a time when the best of friends must
part," said Anglin. "I have been thinking it over,
and the suggestion is that you, my young friends,
must be relieved of any suspicion of willingly associating
with suspicious characters. Gervais, Fred
and I have our mission clearly mapped, the cause
we serve is supreme, and the safeguarding I propose
is of mutual benefit. With you boys here we can
have no open acquaintance, and of us, as we are,
you must claim no memory. To be brief, you have
been detained by rough characters at the other end
of town, and you will be there discovered at the
roadside in the morning bound and gagged and
stripped of all your possessions."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we are mighty poor picking," joked
Billy, "but it is all right to give us the truss up, as
we brought this shake-up to your door."</p>

<p>"That is neither here nor there now," consoled
Anglin; "we must mend the situation as best we
can."</p>

<p>And so it came about, at a point remote from
the red roof, a passing policeman picked up two
much hunted boys who were decidedly the worse
for wear.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>THROUGH FIRE AND FOG.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">You're</span> a pretty pair, I must say."</p>

<p>True it was, the boys were not fixed for any dress
parade when they first faced Roque, immediately
after their delivery to the secret agent by the police
authorities. The crawl through the drain pipe and
the additional effort to give them the appearance
of real victims of violent treatment, had served
to convert the usually natty and trim youngsters
into a couple of quite disreputable looking characters.</p>

<p>It is quite likely that Roque would there and then
have put the returned wanderers through the "third
degree" of questioning had it not been for a fortunate
and welcome interruption in the shape of a
messenger, who could not be denied, and who, it
proved, brought tidings that wholly changed the line
of thought of the stern chief.</p>

<p>"Take these chimney-sweeps to the tub and the
clothesline," he gruffly ordered, and Schneider, half
concealing a broad grin, accepted the service with
celerity.</p>

<p>"You ought to have heard the boss when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
found that you had not reported at quarters last
night," said the red-topped aviator, when the trio
were out of Roque's hearing. "He took the wind
out of my sails, I tell you, and I am not considered
slow in the cussing business."</p>

<p>"Where were you, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"In the hands of brigands, of course," gravely
advised Billy, with a wink at Henri.</p>

<p>Schneider was so possessed with the prospect of
some new and exciting move by Roque, indicated
by the manner of the chief upon receipt of the
message a few minutes before, that he did not burden
the boys by forcing evasive explanations of
their mysterious absence.</p>

<p>"If Roque had half a suspicion that we had been
in company with his pet enemy, the prince of slyboots,"
confided Henri, when the chums were alone,
"our joint name would be Dennis."</p>

<p>"Gee! If that fellow hadn't bumped in just at
the right time, I think we both could have claimed
the title of Ananias!"</p>

<p>Billy was a poor hand as a dodger of truth, and
much relieved to escape the witness stand in this
instance.</p>

<p>The kind of danger with which the boys best
loved to toy was again speedily coming to them&mdash;the
peril of aëroplaning.</p>

<p>Schneider brought the order to report forthwith
at the aërodrome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>At the aërodrome an immense Zeppelin airship,
as long as an ocean liner, had just been
inflated. Roque was engaged in conversation with
the captain of the great dirigible when Schneider
and his young companions reached the grounds.
The pilot of the huge craft and his assistants had
already taken their places in the front gondola, the
foremost end of which had been screened for their
protection, and it was evident that sailing time was
near. When the master mariner had exchanged a
parting word with the secret agent he entered his
room in the central cabin of the Zeppelin, which
was in telephonic communication with the front
and rear gondolas and other parts of the ship. In
the meantime, Schneider had instructed the boys
to give the No. 3's an inspection to see if the attendant
helpers had properly prepared the machines
for a long journey.</p>

<p>The young aviators then surmised that they were
to travel as convoys of the monarch of the
air, which even then was majestically rising.</p>

<p>Roque hastened to the machine in which Billy
was already seated and waved a signal to the waiting
Henri in the other biplane, containing also the
redoubtable Schneider.</p>

<p>The swift flyers easily overcame the slight lead
of the big ship, though it was making 40 knots, and
took up the guiding positions. The flight was directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
away from Lorraine and historic Strassburg.</p>

<p>"I wonder if our huckster friend is in the crowd
back there?" was a mental question with Billy.</p>

<p>It was many a day before the young air pilot
had a chance to again meet Anglin.</p>

<p>When this journey ended it was in territory remote
from that of any former experience of the
Aëroplane Scouts&mdash;a new battle landscape. It had
snowed, and the drab, brown plain of Poland had
turned to glistening white. The biplanes floated
in a tarnished silver sky, which, pressing down,
seemed hardly higher than a gray ceiling. The
aviators landed on the clay bank of the winding
yellow river, the Bzura, within 400 paces of the
German trenches. Gun answered gun across the
golden stream, shell on shell spattered into the soft
earth, and rifles rattled unceasingly.</p>

<p>Schneider sniffed the powder smoke like a seasoned
warhorse. "It's the life!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And the death," added Roque.</p>

<p>He knew that men lay bleeding and broken on
the banks of this yellow streak in the white picture.</p>

<p>"You're just right, boss," murmured Billy, nodding
his hooded head, "the war map looks all red
to me."</p>

<p>Roque, as usual, wherever he went or wherever
he was, seemed to carry an Aladdin magic carpet
on which to sail, for in the next flight of the biplanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a few miles distant he found a bright spot
in this winter scene of rack and ruin&mdash;a clean,
white lodgekeeper's kitchen, where a canary sang,
and where the aërial wayfarers rested and were fed.</p>

<p>"I'll show you even better," he said, "when we
break into Warsaw."</p>

<p>The chief also had a particular crow to pick with
the defenders of the Polish capital. One of his
men, for some time operating with the Russians,
had been detected, and the end of a story of brilliant
secret service achievement was marked by a
little mound of earth in a Warsaw stable yard.</p>

<p>But for the present there were busy days ahead
for the aviators in reconnoitering the Russian lines.</p>

<p>Most of the aërial work here was over a plain,
flat as a floor. Black dots here and there marked
isolated houses, and the Kalish road was bordered
by a line of leafless trees with smooth trunks, which
reminded the young pilots of a rank of grenadiers.</p>

<p>"What's that bunch over there?" queried Billy,
nodding toward a group of horsemen, shrouded in
long caftans, wearing lambskin caps shaped like a
cornucopia, and bearing lances.</p>

<p>"They are Cossacks," replied Roque, from the
observer's perch, "the strange fighters who never
surrender."</p>

<p>Billy had later an opportunity for closer view of
these reckless riders in the service of the Czar.</p>

<p>The flyers could see that the road below was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
this day crowded with the carts of refugees, trailing
in endless procession, on the top of each vehicle the
members of the family, the average one man to
five women. The boys noted that there were not so
many children here as they had seen among the
homeless wanderers in Belgium. The same problem
was here, however&mdash;what are they going to do?</p>

<p>"There they go again," cried Henri, referring
to renewed outbreak from the long gray noses sticking
out over the top of a brown gun emplacement&mdash;belching
cones of death, and shooting red flare
into the gray-white atmosphere. Then another
noise out of the winter-worn copse of trees&mdash;pop,
pop, pop, the notes of rifle fire, all raising a queer
mist over the plain. With all this racketing no soldier
could be seen at the point of fire.</p>

<p>If trouble was contagious, the biplane Henri was
driving suddenly caught some of it; something went
wrong with the motors, and it was a case of get
down quick in the long slide, in which performance
the young pilot excelled. He landed safely enough,
but without choice of place.</p>

<p>The machine was stranded in Sochaezev, a city
of the dead. Pale faces were still peering from
some of the doors and windows, though almost
every roof had been battered in, leaving only the
stringers, reminding one of skeletons.</p>

<p>Billy had instantly volplaned in pursuit of the
disabled biplane of his partner, and the two experts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
assisted by Schneider, were speedily at the work of
repair.</p>

<p>Roque impatiently moved about among the ruins,
acting as a sentinel, and occasionally turning to the
laboring aviators with muttered insistence for haste.</p>

<p>"Hist!"</p>

<p>With the chief's sibilant warning the boys softly
laid down the tools and motor parts they were
handling, and stood at attention. Schneider drew
a revolver from his belt.</p>

<p>Roque, in crouching attitude, held an ear close to
the frozen earth surface, and the others took example.</p>

<p>"There's a cavalry troop headed this way,"
hoarsely whispered Schneider. The pounding of
many hoofs, growing louder and louder, was a
sound apparent to each listener.</p>

<p>Then as a new diversion, out in the open field
to the right of the road, down which the horsemen
were galloping, rang out the rapid blows of
pikes and spades on the ice-covered soil.</p>

<p>"They're throwing up kneeling trenches."</p>

<p>Schneider had a true ear for war moves.</p>

<p>The grating noise of the closing of a gun breech
preceded a tense moment.</p>

<p>By the shifting of sound it was impressed upon
the listeners that the oncoming cavalry had left
the road and had swung into the plain on the left.</p>

<p>"We'll be between two fires in a minute or so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>This from Roque, as he rejoined his companions
standing by the aëroplanes.</p>

<p>"Give us a precious ten minutes and we need not
care," volunteered Henri, who had discovered the
defect in the machinery which had brought them
down.</p>

<p>"Get at it, then," urged Roque.</p>

<p>The boys did "get at it" so vigorously that they
raised a perspiration, despite the frigid air.</p>

<p>"It's all right now," triumphantly announced
Billy, hastily repacking the tools.</p>

<p>That they had been spared the time required to
meet the emergency was due to the fact that the
cavalrymen had diverted their course so as to make
a sudden frontal charge on the artillerymen from
the cover of the ruins.</p>

<p>"Now for a move backward," ordered Roque in
low tone; "even though the gunners to the right
may wear the gray we would have no show for
recognition if we bounced up like a flock of partridges."</p>

<p>So the aviation party cautiously wheeled the biplanes
in the deserted street as far as they could
from the supposed line of the coming clash.</p>

<p>None too soon were they out of range, for with
savage yells the Cossacks rode full-tilt from cover
at the German guns and gunners in the shallow
trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Amidst the roar of desperate conflict the biplanes
whizzed away like great arrows.</p>

<p>"Some speedy tinkering we did in that ghost
town, Mr. Roque?"</p>

<p>"Nothing slow," assented Roque, leaning forward
to give Billy a pat on the back.</p>

<p>"Where away now?" asked the pilot.</p>

<p>"Back to the lodge for the night," directed the
chief.</p>

<p>No such comfort for the boys in the next flight.</p>

<p>They were booked for a journey to Przemysl,
the vast underground fortress of Galicia, about
which the Russian right end was then snapping
like the tip of a whip around a sapling, and later
surrounded on all sides by the Muscovite forces.</p>

<p>While viewing the first back-wash of the Austrian
forces from the high tide of Russian invasion,
the aviators had hurtled through a maelstrom
of noise. The yells and shoutings of wagon drivers,
the rattling of thousands of wheels over stony
roads, the clatter of horses' feet made an indescribable
tumult, and to this were added the sounds of
infantry fighting.</p>

<p>Roque had reliable advices during one of the
stops in the flight that the fortress defenders were
still holding their own, and no Russian charge had
as yet crossed the barbed wire mazes that circled
the city.</p>

<p>Never since the memorable race at Friedrichshaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had the No. 3 type of biplane attained such
velocity as in the finish of this forced run to the
Galician stronghold, the final dash over the black-plowed
farms through a wet fog and under fire
of a Russian battery posted in the hills.</p>

<p>"I feel like I had been hauled through the lower
regions by a nightmare," complained Billy, as he
later sat with Roque, Schneider and his chum in
the Steiber Coffee house.</p>

<p>"I will say," confessed Schneider, "that I never
hit the wind so hard before in my flying experience.
My eyes must look like two burned holes in a
blanket."</p>

<p>"I might say, Schneider," remarked Roque, "that
if it had not been for that timely fog you would
have hit the ground harder than you ever did before.
Those gunners on the hill could not have
missed us if given fair sight."</p>

<p>"It has just occurred to me that they came pretty
close, anyhow."</p>

<p>"They sure did, Buddy," laughed Billy, following
this assertion by his chum. "I almost collided
with a shell that sounded like a dozen factory whistles.
By the way, Mr. Roque," he continued, "it
looks like you were tied up here for some time to
come. I don't see any way out of it."</p>

<p>"Do not lose any sleep over that problem, young
man; if we got in we can get out. You ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
know by this time that there is always a hole in
the air that cannot be blocked."</p>

<p>"You bet he's right," exclaimed Schneider, slapping
his knee for emphasis.</p>

<p>"Hustle for bed, all of you, and stay there until
you are called."</p>

<p>With this the chief faced the fire and lighted one
of his big, black cigars. He had some thinking
to do.</p>

<p>The boys were awakened the next morning by
gunfire.</p>

<p>"Oh, lawsy," sleepily murmured Billy, "is there
another battle started already?"</p>

<p>Schneider at the first report had gone on his bare
feet to the nearest window.</p>

<p>"Nix, fellows," he cried, after short observation,
"they're not shooting at men this time, it's
wild geese they're popping at."</p>

<p>The besieged garrison was adding to its store of
eatables by bringing down wildfowl, which flew in
abundance over the town.</p>

<p>"Let me in on that."</p>

<p>Henri owned the idea that he was something
of a full hand as a Nimrod.</p>

<p>A voice in the doorway: "You will be 'let in' on
bigger game than that."</p>

<p>Roque smiled at the youthful enthusiast, and
added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a man's size job for a half-sized man
waiting until you shake the sleep out of your system."</p>

<p>"Get up, you snowbirds, and sing for your salt."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>CAPTURED BY COSSACKS.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Colonel</span>, permit me to present a likely pair
of air travelers who are never satisfied with the
ground space they occupy."</p>

<p>Billy and Henri tipped their caps to six-feet-three
of superb manhood, in Austrian uniform of
dark blue.</p>

<p>Roque made the introduction, and the boys felt
quite sure that this ceremony only completed advance
notice of the character of service they were
capable of rendering.</p>

<p>The officer, measuring the young aviators with
a keen gray eye, nodded approbation.</p>

<p>"They will admirably fit in the carrying service,"
he remarked to Roque; "they are jockey weight,
which is a good point for the assignment."</p>

<p>Billy assumed from the manner, if not the language
used, that Henri and himself had successfully
passed inspection.</p>

<p>It appeared that airmen here were persons of
some importance, as affording the only connecting
link with the outside world.</p>

<p>Almost every day, the boys were advised, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
aëroplane went to Galician headquarters, on the outward
flight carrying only letters and postcards,
but on the return trip bringing tinned meats and
hand grenades for the soldiers.</p>

<p>The big biplane piloted by Billy and Henri
dwarfed anything else in the way of air machines
shown in the fortress.</p>

<p>Other aviators, viewing the No. 3's, cheerfully
conceded that they were certainly built to be winners.</p>

<p>These experts, however, as usual with their kind
just getting acquainted with our boys, were inclined
to be doubtful of the capacity of the youngsters
to rank with themselves as drivers of aircraft.</p>

<p>It was up to time&mdash;a little time&mdash;to convince
them of their error of judgment.</p>

<p>The crack driver of the Przemysl air squadron,
Stanislaws, which name Billy promptly shortened
to "Stanny," was the earliest convert to the new
belief when he went as observer with the boy from
Bangor on the latter's first foraging detail.</p>

<p>Lack of knowledge of the country prevented the
chums from working together at this period.</p>

<p>"He will show me the way, but just hazard a
little guess that I'll have a little show of my own
on the way."</p>

<p>Billy buzzed this in the ear of the grinning
Schneider, when the order to get away was received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Henri, with the comfort that his turn was coming,
stoutly backed the belief that his partner intended
to exceed the speed limit as a lesson to the
doubters.</p>

<p>"'Stanny' will have a new kink in his whiskers
before he gets back," was the expression, to be
exact, used by Henri on this evening.</p>

<p>The great bird machine, soaring like an albatross
in the northern sky, soon vanished from the view
of the watchers in the fortifications.</p>

<p>"He's six horses and a wagon with a dog under
it," Stanislaws earnestly advised the officers at army
headquarters, pointing at Billy, who was reducing
heat in the propeller by liberal use of the oil can.</p>

<p>"Stanny" had already made good with the American
boy, not so much by his frank expression of
admiration for the youngster's handling of the
military biplane as for the reason that the Austrian
talked plain United States when they were alone.
Billy was dead-set against the trial of eternally
groping for the meaning of foreign phrases.</p>

<p>"Do you know why we aviators are running a
freight line just now?" queried this new friend.</p>

<p>Billy acknowledged that he had not the least
idea on that subject. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Filimonoff."</p>

<p>"Who in the dickens is Filimonoff?"</p>

<p>"He is the greatest of all Cossacks," explained
the senior airman, "and the very devil on two sticks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Near Przemysl, not long ago, he held up one of
our convoys and captured 200 wagons of grain and
coal. He strikes where least expected, plays the
peasant to perfection and secretly gets a lot of information
that does not belong to him. It would
be worth a lot to a fellow who dulled the spurs of
this cock of the walk."</p>

<p>"Ah hum," thought Billy, "I can pretty near
guess now what brought Roque to this neck of
the woods."</p>

<p>So long was the enforced wait at headquarters
this day that it was not until after nightfall that
the biplane set out on its return voyage to the
fortress.</p>

<p>A strong air current from the north, with a decided
snap to it, forced the aviators out of fixed
course, but despite the biting blast Stanislaws was
yet able to advise the pilot as to the general direction
to be pursued.</p>

<p>They saw ahead of them a red glow and the uplift
of a spreading fountain of sparks. It was a
house burning to the ground, probably fired by a
Russian shell.</p>

<p>The blaze revealed a familiar landmark to the
biplane observer. "Keep her nose to the left," he
advised the pilot.</p>

<p>Billy, who figured the speed fully 70 miles to the
hour, had the machine under perfect control, and
it instantly responded to every shift of the steering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
lever. With the ordered slight turn it was scarce
ten minutes before the biplane hovered over the
vast, shadowy mass of the fortress below. The
powerful propeller stopped, and the winged racer
stood still against the black dome of the midnight
sky. Now the forward plane dipped as the throbbing
of the motor again was heard, and the bird
machine plunged down at an angle of 45 degrees,
settling in the plaza within the silvery ring formed
by its own searchlight.</p>

<p>"The work of an artist," proclaimed Stanislaws
to the aviators in the night watch.</p>

<p>"Carrying some weight, too," added the soldier
who superintended the removal of the cargo.</p>

<p>Billy had a bedtime story for Henri about Filimonoff.</p>

<p>It having been determined to regularly use both
biplanes in the carrying service, the detail at last
put the boys together in the same machine, with
Stanislaws and Schneider manning the other.</p>

<p>"None of your self-made adventures," Roque
admonished, when he had informed Billy and Henri
of the arrangement.</p>

<p>The young aviators were, in duty bound, compelled
to mumble some sort of assurance that they
would stick closely to the task set for them.</p>

<p>That they failed to keep the agreement proved,
strange to say, the fault of Schneider, the very man
charged to keep an eye on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the third aërial expedition of the week,
and following the same route, without mishap, had
no longer the charm of novelty to Billy and Henri,
and, it may be stated, the easy sailing had begun,
also, to pall on the high-strung warrior with the
sorrel hair, now sitting as observer behind the Austrian
pilot.</p>

<p>At army headquarters, Stanislaws was giving his
entire time and attention to checking up the needs
of the garrison, and figuring closely on the capacity
of the biplanes to carry all that he deemed absolutely
necessary to take back to the fortress on this
particular return journey.</p>

<p>The balance of the crew&mdash;the trio who were getting
weary of the uneventful freight business&mdash;had
nothing special to do but wait.</p>

<p>"No use of sitting still and twiddling our thumbs;
I don't see any harm in looking around a bit."</p>

<p>Schneider's suggestion appealed to his companions,
and they had no trouble in securing the
loan of a pony each from the large number of
these hardy specimens of horseflesh browsing
around the camp.</p>

<p>They were advised by a good-natured member
of the commissary department not to venture too
far beyond the line of patrols, and Stanislaws gave
them to understand that he expected to be ready to
start within the next three hours.</p>

<p>"We'll be here on time all right, Stanny," called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Billy, clucking his pony into a smart canter, following
the lead of his similarly mounted friends.</p>

<p>The one who was left behind had no reckoning
then that he need not have hurried in his packing.</p>

<p>The roads traversed by the riders were deep in
slush and mud because of a thaw, but the fresh
ponies reveled in the going, and it was not long
before a tempting range of harder ground extended
the gallop further afield.</p>

<p>"Say, boys," suddenly remarked Schneider, rising
in the stirrups for a survey of their whereabouts,
"I think we have gone about far enough, and must
take the back-track immediately."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," urged Henri, "there's a man
waving to us over there."</p>

<p>Schneider, looking in the direction indicated by
the boy at his side, saw it was a peasant who was
making the friendly motions to attract their attention.</p>

<p>"What's the word, my friend?"</p>

<p>The peasant spread out his hands in gesture of
cordial yet humble greeting. "My house is near"
(pointing eastward over the plain). "It is yours."</p>

<p>"The sun is yet high, let's go over and see the
house of his nobs," gayly proposed Billy.</p>

<p>The native shrugged his shoulders, and wore a
puzzled look at the words in a tongue evidently
foreign to him.</p>

<p>Henri supplied the information in German, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
being the language in which the invitation had been
extended to them.</p>

<p>"I think he could understand even better if we
were talking Russ, but still, as he made a fair stagger
in German, we will have to let it go at that.
We can see him home, as he says it is near, and
then strike out for headquarters."</p>

<p>Prodding his shaggy steed with his heavy boot-heels,
the stranger showed the path to his guests,
the party speedily reaching a small but solidly built
farmhouse on the bank of a small river.</p>

<p>Schneider, with soldierly precaution, transferred
the heavy service revolver he carried in his belt to
a convenient pocket under the cape of his overcoat.</p>

<p>Perhaps the husky fighter felt it was not much
of an exhibit of courage to set a gun at hand when
he found that no other human than this old farmer
with a crook in his back seemed to inhabit the
premises.</p>

<p>"I was as dry as a fish," asserted Billy, eagerly
accepting a drink of cold water from a stone mug
proffered by their host. There were other thirsty
ones in the party, for the mug was emptied several
times in the passing.</p>

<p>Just about that time Schneider lost all interest in
water. Happening to glance out of a window facing
to the north, his eye caught a sunflash on a
lance-head, and now and again other sparkling
tips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The revolver he now appreciated was in the right
place.</p>

<p>But of what avail, after all, was one pistol against
a band of reckless and wily Cossacks, if such were
under those nine-foot lances?</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were unarmed.</p>

<p>The peasant was up with a jump when Schneider
proclaimed his discovery of impending peril.</p>

<p>"Hide! Hide!"</p>

<p>With the words of alarm he tugged at an iron
ring in the center of the heavily-planked floor.</p>

<p>It was considerable of a lift, this weighty trap-door,
but the old man developed a surprising degree
of activity and strength, and quickly presented
the way to a cellar by means of a ladder, the length
of which indicated considerable depth.</p>

<p>"Not for me," strenuously objected Schneider;
"they will never catch us like rats in a trap."</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick!" pleaded the peasant.</p>

<p>Billy, at the window, excitedly announced:</p>

<p>"They're the real thing; I can tell by their caps
and caftans. The Cossacks are here!"</p>

<p>Schneider was as cool as a cucumber&mdash;that was
the way the near prospect of a death struggle always
affected him. He was hot-headed only when
given the smaller provocations.</p>

<p>"Bar that door!"</p>

<p>The boys hastened to obey that crisp command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The old peasant attempted to leave the house before
the entrance barrier was secured and fastened.</p>

<p>"Halt!"</p>

<p>An unwavering line of steel barrel, and the
menace of the voice behind it, checked stockstill
this attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Fully a dozen of the rough riders of the north
had dismounted in the farm enclosure, and advanced
upon the house, some with lances and others carrying
curved swords without guards.</p>

<p>"Get away from the windows," hissed Schneider,
himself backing against the wall. "You too," savagely
addressing the peasant, who in the past few
moments continued to show remarkable recovery
from the infirmity of bent shoulders and halting
step. The man nervously fingered the folds of
his rusty green tunic as he obeyed the fiercely given
command, and as he stood nearest to Billy the latter
was inclined to keep at least the corner of his eye
peeled on the suspect. It was well for Schneider
that the boy was watchful, for when the supposed
farmer stealthily lowered his hand it grasped the
bone haft of a dagger.</p>

<p>The Cossacks outside vigorously pounded the
door with lance butt and sword hilt, and receiving
no response to their peremptory summons, set powerful
shoulders to work. But they could not budge
or even shake the solid barrier.</p>

<p>Then at the window appeared a bearded face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ferocious type, surmounted by high-crowned lambskin
cap.</p>

<p>Schneider slowly raised his revolver.</p>

<p>The transformed peasant, noting the action,
crouched like a panther for a spring, which he
made the same instant. But the murderous intent
was baffled and the leap fell short.</p>

<p>Billy Barry's foot was purposely in the way, and
the would-be dagger wielder hit the floor with a
crash. Startled by the tumble, Schneider's trigger-finger
caused the waste of one revolver shot,
and spoiled further attempt to deceive by silence.</p>

<p>In the moment of excitement no thought had been
given by the defenders to the rear of the house,
and before Schneider could even turn on his heel,
a half-dozen lance points threatened him, front
and back.</p>

<p>The fallen peasant was on his feet in a flash, and
it was a mighty ugly look that he fixed on Billy.</p>

<p>"You will go to the cellar now, because I say
it, and will come out again if I will it."</p>

<p>The sign of leadership was on the man, for none
of the strange soldiery about him ventured to speak
even a word in his presence.</p>

<p>Schneider, disarmed and no longer resisting, was
hustled into the dark hole in the floor, and the boys
were forcibly assisted in the same gloomy descent.</p>

<p>The heavy trap was closed with a bang, and
sealed by the crossing of a clanking chain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>A WONDERFUL RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Blamed</span> if I oughtn't to be treated for the simples."</p>

<p>Schneider was, indeed, a dejected figure at the
foot of the long ladder in this inky well, the only
point of light being a porthole sort of window, set
high in one of the four stone walls.</p>

<p>"We're all of the same name as chumps," echoed
Billy.</p>

<p>The situation certainly had serious aspect to the
prisoners. While they had considerable confidence
in the trailing ability of Roque, here was a case
with about every chance in the world against successful
tracing.</p>

<p>An isolated farmhouse, far from the beaten track,
not even in present line of military operations, and
confinement practically in a granite tomb, from
which no wail of distress could possibly be heard
outside.</p>

<p>What fate the Cossacks had fixed for them was
merely a matter of dreadful surmise.</p>

<p>"Slow starvation," was Henri's unhappy guess.</p>

<p>"Penned up in this den until we go mad," was
the blood-chilling view of Schneider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, you fellows give me the creeps."</p>

<p>Billy wanted his troubles one at a time.</p>

<p>The next one was all too near.</p>

<p>While feeling his way around the rocky walls,
Schneider settled in his tracks as though he had
been shot.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear water splashing?" For confirmation
he stared blankly at the boys who had not
as yet strayed away from the ladder.</p>

<p>"Are you starting your madhouse already?" demanded
Billy.</p>

<p>"But there is water running near," insisted
Schneider. "Come over here, if you don't believe
it."</p>

<p>As if to humor their friend, the boys joined him.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the lapping sound was plainly audible
at this point.</p>

<p>Further ahead in the dim recesses of the cellar
the sound was of dripping, a steady patter like
rain.</p>

<p>"Maybe they have pulled a sluice between here
and the river," suggested Henri.</p>

<p>"The fiends," muttered Schneider.</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed Billy, starting back from a forward
step or two, "the floor is filling!"</p>

<p>Stealing along, inch by inch, the water spread
throughout the cellar.</p>

<p>The prisoners retreated to the foot of the ladder
and sought perches on the rungs. In case of full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
flood they could stave off drowning for a time by
climbing higher. It was the only way.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty tight place we're in, old man, but
not for the first time, and, mind you, we have always
pulled out somehow."</p>

<p>Billy was ever ready to pass a cheering word to
his chum when cheering words were most needed.</p>

<p>Schneider's nerve was again in the ascendant, he
having sufficiently abused his lack of horse sense
in being so easily led into such a trap.</p>

<p>"If I had hold of a good steel pike for a bit of
an hour, there is nothing like a few planks that
would keep us down here."</p>

<p>"Yes, or a couple of axes, or a stick of dynamite,
or an electric torch, and so forth," bantered Billy.</p>

<p>While Schneider and Billy were word sparring to
keep up their spirits, Henri noticed that the water
on the cellar floor had pooled in the sunken spots,
indicating that the pressure from without, for the
time being, had largely subsided.</p>

<p>"No need for life belts yet," he cried, "the river
isn't going to come through."</p>

<p>"And, thanks to that blessed streak of light,"
Billy pointing to the bull's-eye window, "we're
able to see that you are right. So much for a
starter."</p>

<p>"We'll beat you yet."</p>

<p>Schneider shook his fist at some invisible foe on
the other side of the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>When, however, the first flush of encouragement
at the fading of the flood had dimmed, it seemed
a small matter about which to rejoice. The situation
appeared as hopeless as before to the imprisoned
aviators. With the coming of night the one
diamond in the sable setting vanished&mdash;no ray of
light to slightly relieve a condition now of absolute
blindness.</p>

<p>"Oh, for one more glorious chance to meet those
dastards in the open," groaned Schneider, who
again was overwhelmed with keen regret that he
had surrendered at all in the first place. But then
he had no idea of such a dungeon as this, and,
too, he had feared to provoke instant death for his
young comrades.</p>

<p>In the coming dismal hours the troubled trio,
deserting their ladder perches, stretched their aching
bones upon the slimy floor, and passed the night
in uneasy slumber.</p>

<p>Henri was the first to awaken, and as a morning
exercise essayed to reach the little window by working
hand and toe as a means of scaling the rough
surface of the wall. As he clung for a fleeting moment
to a protruding stone his chief discovery
through the aperture was that outside it was raining
in torrents.</p>

<p>Perhaps not much satisfaction in return for sadly
torn fingernails and considerable waste of already
waning energy, yet it was some assurance that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
were not intended victims of a drowning plot of
man's conception.</p>

<p>"It's not the river that is feeding this drip," announced
the climber to his companions in misery,
"it's raining like fury and the water coming in
here is the gutter fall through these rocks."</p>

<p>"A bally lot of moisture," growled Schneider,
splashing ankle-deep across the cellar to inspect a
swinging shelf which had just caught his eye.</p>

<p>He reached up, and presently turned, holding at
arm's length a mouldy sailcloth bag.</p>

<p>"Hidden treasure," whooped Billy. "Bring it
nearer the light, Schneider."</p>

<p>The treasure proved to be meal of some sort in
a fair state of preservation. A tasting test demonstrated
that here was something that would at least
dull the gnawing pains of hunger, when mixed with
water, of which latter there was more than a plenty.</p>

<p>"We might make a fire out of the shelf," suggested
Henri, "and turn this stuff into hot cakes.
I've got a few matches in my pocket."</p>

<p>"I see a picture of the fire you could make down
here," exclaimed Billy. "But what's the matter
with trying it out on the trap door? Burn our
way out."</p>

<p>The speaker had taken on an air of excitement
at the prospect.</p>

<p>Alas! The matches in Henri's possession had
been carried on his sleeping side, the side all night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in contact with the slimy floor. There was not a
strike in one of them.</p>

<p>Schneider, inveterate smoker that he was, remembered
that his pipe, tobacco and match-case
were all in the pocket of his great coat, of which
the Cossacks had divested him after capture.</p>

<p>So in silence the unfortunate three mouthed the
soaked meal, bitterly disappointed that they could
not realize upon Billy's brilliant idea.</p>

<p>From bad to worse, they did realize, and soon,
upon a much less desirable development. The rain
had no stop this time to reduce the water flow into
the cellar. In restoring the meal sack to the shelf
for safekeeping, Schneider's long boots were wetted
to the knees, and there was nothing to do but mount
the ladder, and stay there.</p>

<p>To save a fall when napping, the prisoners lengthened
their belts and buckled themselves each to a
rung above the one upon which he sat.</p>

<p>"While you were wishing awhile ago, Schneider,
why didn't you wish for a boat?"</p>

<p>"You'd joke on the way to the scaffold, young
man," said the subdued firebrand, fixing a reproachful
look on Billy.</p>

<p>"Never say die," retorted the irrepressible youth.</p>

<p>Another wearing night, and in Schneider's next
trip for the meal bag his hip boots were none too
long in the matter of preventing his taking on a
cargo of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>But this third day of desperate contemplation was
destined to be marked by an incident which resulted
in the lifting of the weight of gloom&mdash;and the herald
of light and liberation from an apparently hopeless
imprisonment was four-footed.</p>

<p>A few lines now in backward trend, to tell about
the ambulance dogs, as many as a thousand, renowned
for their excellent service for the Germans
in both the eastern and western theaters of war.
Each of the sanitary companies has attached to
it four of these dogs, the German shepherd breed,
marvelously trained and fitted for work on the battlefield,
commanding everywhere eloquent tribute
for their remarkable performances in finding the
wounded and their acute scent on any trail.</p>

<p>Stanislaws had long completed his packing of the
biplanes, and many a time and oft had impatiently
paced Commissary Square, as many times going to
the military road upon which he had last seen his
aviation comrades riding joyously away. "'Stanny'
was in a stew," as Billy would have put it, and he
was not averse to letting anyone about him know it.</p>

<p>When night came word was passed from patrol
to patrol, and back again, and no definite report of
the missing aviators.</p>

<p>An observer was secured from among the young
officers in the camp, and Stanislaws himself piloted
one of the biplanes on the return journey to the
fortress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Roque was immediately advised of the mysterious
disappearance of his three followers, and
promptly indulged in some very emphatic comments
not appropriate for parlor use.</p>

<p>"You must fly again in an hour," he raged, "and
I'll be with you."</p>

<p>Stanislaws, though weary and nerve-strained
through the exertions of the long flight just concluded
and by the weight of anxiety, would not
listen to the offer of brother aviators to relieve him
of the added exertion of repeating such a journey
without rest.</p>

<p>"I'm going back with him," he stoutly maintained&mdash;and
he did.</p>

<p>At headquarters Roque took advantage of the
first glimpse of daylight to institute work of inquiry,
in which practice he was conceded to be without
equal. But to no avail. The furthest outpost
had seen the riders pass, and, fully satisfied
with their credentials, had paid no further attention
to their movements.</p>

<p>Somewhere out on the boundless plain, alive or
dead, were the three so earnestly and expertly
sought for.</p>

<p>"It's a hard nut to crack," Roque stated to a
group of officers, "but I have opened just such
hulls before, and I am not ready yet to plead inefficiency."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they have fallen into the hands of the
enemy," said one of the officers.</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe that an old campaigner
like Schneider would run into the lines of the foe
with his eyes open. If suddenly attacked by lurking
prowlers, I'll warrant we'll find some sign, for
I know the man too well to believe he would be
taken without a struggle and somebody biting the
dust."</p>

<p>Roque had evidently not figured on Schneider's
present handicap in the shape of the boys, forcing
discretion ahead of valor.</p>

<p>Then the winning thought flashed into the mind
of the secret agent&mdash;put the ambulance dogs on
the trail!</p>

<p>The reminder was the approach of one of the
sanitary officers. The latter, when he was told of
the situation, at first presented a doubtful front.</p>

<p>"The heavy rains out there," said he, indicating
the plain by a sweeping movement, "have drowned
the scent, even if we had a good lead from this
point; but," he concluded, noting the disappointment
in the face of Roque, "I do not mind making a try
for it. Here, Blitz."</p>

<p>The splendid animal bounded to the side of his
master, lifting expressive eyes, and indulging in a
series of short barks, showing readiness to serve
in the best dog language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Hasten, dog, there is sore need for aid in a dark
place of yonder sea of mud!</p>

<p>Schneider, Billy and Henri had not ventured
from the ladder since the early move after the meal-bag,
which the first named had decided to keep
within reach, and save further wading to the shelf.
The flood on the floor showed no sign of receding&mdash;indeed,
the trio had twice been compelled within
the hour to climb a little higher to escape the splash
at their feet.</p>

<p>Schneider, anything for diversion, pounded on
the trapdoor until his knuckles were a bleeding
mass, shouting until he was hoarse.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he dully questioned, settling
again into an attitude of sullen indifference.</p>

<p>The boys set up a duet, but with discord so apparent,
even to themselves, that they quit the singing
attempt as a matter of self-defense.</p>

<p>This noise had hardly ceased, when Schneider
poked his head around the ladder support on the
side of the light, with a hand hollowed behind his
ear.</p>

<p>"Jumping jingo; listen!"</p>

<p>They all heard at once the snuffing of a dog, and
with the sight of its black head stuck into the bull's-eye
window, Billy dropped into the flood, breast
deep, and struck out for the wall, up which he
swarmed, regardless of scrape or strain.</p>

<p>He had seen the ambulance dogs in camp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
knew of the breed and their doings. Holding onto
the narrow ledge like grim death with one hand, he
used the other and his teeth in tearing out the scarlet
lining from his cap, which he twisted around
the dog's collar band. Blitz&mdash;for Blitz it was&mdash;whined
his receipt for the red token, backed from
the aperture, and padded away like the wind.</p>

<p>Two hours later the trap was lifted, and the exhausted
survivors of this desperate adventure were
hauled into daylight, joyfully greeted by a goodly
company, including Roque. Stanislaws, sanitary officers,
pioneers, and last, but not least, Blitz, tugging
at the line by which he led the rescue party to
the scene of his original discovery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>DUEL TO THE DEATH.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Schneider</span> was a very walking furnace, with his
burning desire to meet again, on equal footing, any
individual of the Cossack band that had thrust him,
lamblike, into the stone tomb under the farmhouse,
and, particularly, the fake peasant for whose wiles
he had so foolishly fallen.</p>

<p>"Give us a biplane hunt for that gang," he importuned
Roque, "or I will never get the red out
of my eyes. Filimonoff himself might have been
in the crowd, for all I know, and you ought to be
doing some tall bidding for his headdress. It was
just like one of his tricks."</p>

<p>The firebrand felt that he had hit the mark with
the last part of his heated argument. Roque would
have counted full reward for the chase in the bagging
alone of the wily chieftain of the strange
horsemen.</p>

<p>He turned to Stanislaws, remarking: "You men
for awhile will have to resume the use of your
own machines in the carrying service. I have concluded
to give Schneider a chance to retrieve his
blunder and return a lesson that will stick into
savage hides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"We won't stand in the way for a minute," quickly
and earnestly stated the Austrian flyer, "and
more power to you, sir. What's more," he added,
"we can spare an aëroplane or two, and I know
several full-blooded lads who would be mighty
willing to join such an excursion."</p>

<p>"Meaning that you are one of the volunteers,"
rejoined Roque. "How about it, Schneider?"</p>

<p>"It is hitting the nail on the head," heartily approved
the brick-top warrior, "Stanislaws, Breckens,
Bishoff, and Mendell&mdash;there's two crews that
would help some."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with us?"</p>

<p>The Aëroplane Scouts had edged into the circle.
The idea of a biplane hunt especially appealed to
them.</p>

<p>"Sure you're going," proclaimed Schneider,
glancing first at Roque for sign of assent, which
was given by a nod.</p>

<p>Four military biplanes twelve hours hence lay
in readiness to start for the Cossack roundup. The
Austrians in the party carried a supply of bombs
for emergency work, but the most elaborately armed
of all was Schneider, in the rôle of chief challenger.
He bristled with revolvers, a shoulder-hung carbine
and a heavy cavalry saber.</p>

<p>"If you should have a fall, old fellow," laughed
Stanislaws, "it would sound like a barrel of tinware
rolling down a mountain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never you mind," said the one-man arsenal, "I
have a job of making sieves on hand."</p>

<p>The plan was to hover for a time in the vicinity
of the farm where Schneider and the boys had been
held up, or, rather, down, and if no sight of the
Cossack company, to reconnoiter still further north.</p>

<p>The flyers were given a great send-off by the
soldiers at headquarters.</p>

<p>"Just like a balloon ascension at a county fair,"
observed Billy, as he took his place as pilot in front
of Roque.</p>

<p>"Something new here, I see," Henri calling the
attention of his aviation companion Schneider, to
the fact that Stanislaws had provided telephone
helmets for each of the crews, whereby pilot and
observer could communicate with one another without
yelling their heads off, receivers over the ears
and a transmitter close to the mouth.</p>

<p>"This will save my voice for singing," jollied
Henri.</p>

<p>Schneider, remembering the vocal effort in the
cellar, came back with the expression of hope that
the telephone invention would not serve to that
extent.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are a jealous cuss," declared the
boy, as he guided the machine upward, in compliance
with the signal given to all by Roque.</p>

<p>"We have all the advantage this time,"'phoned
Billy to Roque, when the flight was well under way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
"if the outfit below is too heavy for us we can stay
out of reach; if we feel that we can lick them, a
dive will settle the question&mdash;our choice both ways."</p>

<p>For the first few miles all the creeping figures
below were of the friendly forces, but with the
onrush of the aëroplanes all traces of the camp
were obliterated and only a trackless waste presented
itself to the view of the lofty travelers.</p>

<p>Directly, Schneider reported to his pilot that the
farm enclosure was just ahead, with its yellow ribbon
border, which the river wound around it.</p>

<p>The observers on the four biplanes gave the premises
a thorough looking over with their glasses, but
had no announcement to make of any human movement
below.</p>

<p>Separating the machines, each distant from the
other several hundred yards, the pilots guided northward,
at reduced speed, and within a few hundred
feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Some twenty miles forward, the little fleet encountered
a snowstorm, and the earth was already
covered with a dazzling white carpet.</p>

<p>A range of hills forced a higher flying altitude,
and in an atmosphere growing decidedly chilly.
The aviators were quickly compelled to close their
coats at the throat, and to huddle down in the protecting
folds of their service blankets.</p>

<p>On a high level, Roque instructed Billy to make
a stop, so that the long sitting airmen might work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the cramp out of their joints by a brisk runabout.
The snow had little depth on the wind-swept plateau,
and landing could be made with smooth certainty.</p>

<p>A spot of blackened surface showed bare through
the powdery snow covering, indicating a recent
campfire there.</p>

<p>"Trot out the coffee pot," Henri called to Schneider,
"here are the makings of a blaze."</p>

<p>The recent heavy rains had filled with water the
rocky basins near at hand, and the thin skim of
ice now forming thereover was easily broken.</p>

<p>The Austrians elected tea as their special inspiration
on the occasion, and the rival fumes soon
ascended from the spouts of coffee and teapots.</p>

<p>As the sky above was now clearing, from the
elevation the aviators could see the brown and
white summits of other hills, divided by valley cuttings,
as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Schneider was just about to light his beloved
briar pipe, when all of a sudden he dropped the
ember he was lifting to the bowl, and pointed
toward the high ground edging the opposite side
of an intervening gulch to the right of their bivouac.</p>

<p>A solitary horseman had ridden into view, and
both rider and steed posed, statue-like, on the verge
of the steeply descending slope.</p>

<p>Roque like a flash covered the smouldering fire
with a blanket, checking tell-tale spirals of smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Fixing a glass on the equestrian, Stanislaws uttered
the one word&mdash;"Cossack."</p>

<p>"He's our meat," snapped Schneider.</p>

<p>"It's your first go this time," reluctantly conceded
Stanislaws, who was himself aching to draw first
blood.</p>

<p>Schneider, taking general consent for granted,
gave Henri a nod sidewise, and both moved as
quickly as they could on all fours to their biplane.
While the boy was getting the motors in play, the
fighting observer shifted his carbine from shoulder
to knee.</p>

<p>The buzzing of the aëroplane had evidently
caught the ear of the wild cavalryman across the
gulch, for the horse was rearing, lifted by an unexpected
wrench of the bit.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, on four legs or two, would
have a ghost of a chance to outdistance a racing
aëroplane.</p>

<p>Spur as he would, the horseman was overhauled
in the space of three minutes.</p>

<p>The aëroplane, skimming the earth, mixed its
scattering of snow particles with those raised by
the pounding hoofs of the wildly galloping horse.</p>

<p>So close together were pursuer and pursued, that
the Cossack's first lance thrust came within a hairline
of reaching the ribs of Schneider, leaning forward
in preparation to make a flying leap from the
aircraft when it should lessen speed sufficiently to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
enable him to keep his feet when alighting on the
stony soil.</p>

<p>Why the observer did not immediately use carbine
or revolver in return for the lance attack,
queerly impressed the young pilot ahead, who, naturally,
would expect such action on the part of
his armed companion, gravely menaced by a wicked
weapon too lengthy to be successfully resisted by
counter strokes of a saber.</p>

<p>Henri's second thought was that Schneider had
been touched in a vital spot by the steel point, and
that he, too, would next get into the deal of death.
To send the machine aloft was a third thought, following
in a flash, but the execution of this purpose
was as quickly delayed by a motion indicating a
lift of weight behind. Schneider had jumped from
the biplane, now wheeling the ground, and within
two lengths of a precipice, hitherto unobserved.</p>

<p>The Cossack, on the very brink of this dizzy declivity,
had jerked his horse to its haunches, at the
same moment when Henri checked further movement
of the biplane by a skillful side turn.</p>

<p>"It's you and me for it now," roared Schneider,
"and the devil take the quitter!"</p>

<p>Turning in his saddle, the Cossack, desperately
at bay, accepted the challenge with ferocious alacrity,
backing the fiery animal he bestrode and taking
to foot with drawn sword.</p>

<p>Henri saw that it was the same man who in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
guise of a peasant had played them such a scurvy
trick&mdash;the same, but yet seeming hardly possible,
viewing this upstanding, powerful specimen of a
hardy, unconquerable race.</p>

<p>Schneider, never forgetting a face, had known
the impersonator at the first glance, which added to
the incentive of wiping out the score created by the
Cossack company at the farmhouse down on the
plain.</p>

<p>Noting that his adversary was armed only with
sword and dagger, having blunted his lance against
the armored side of the biplane, the aviation firebrand
discarded his carbine and pistol, tossing them
one by one onto the snow carpet. He had the notion
of settling this affair in a manner that would
completely retrieve certain prestige of which he
conceived himself to be the loser.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the balance of the aviation
party swooped down upon this level, and leaving
their biplanes, advanced to the scene of the impending
duel.</p>

<p>"Keep back, all of you," shouted Schneider, the
bloodlust gleaming from his eyes; "it is one to one
here, and though he put twenty to one against me,
I will give him his chance, and take mine."</p>

<p>"Better humor him," suggested Stanislaws in
an aside to Roque, "he will never rest easy if he
does not get rid of the black mark he has rubbed on
his own nose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"He may get a red mark or two in this combat,"
grimly observed Roque, "but let them fight it out.
Schneider ought to be able to take care of himself."</p>

<p>Billy and Henri followed with fascinated gaze the
movements of their champion, who, though he sized
up almost half a head shorter than his extremely
tall antagonist, was all wire and a swordsman without
equal in the estimation of the Heidelberg student
body.</p>

<p>The duelists indulged in no time-saving tactics.
Schneider rushed his man from the outset, but
every rapid lunge of his heavy saber found clashing
counter from the curved and guardless steel in the
practiced hand of the wily Cossack.</p>

<p>Forward and back, ever fiercely fencing, the
sworn foes panted defiance at one another, and each
with blasting words renewed efforts to strike a
death blow.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Billy had seen blood dripping from
Schneider's left sleeve, and leaving a tiny trail of
carmine splotches in the trampled snow. In agony
of apprehension, the boy again fairly shouted:
"Don't let him down you, Schneider; look out for
the next!"</p>

<p>Roque gave the excited lad a muttered order to
hold his tongue.</p>

<p>"Ha!" This from Stanislaws. A scarlet seam
crossed the forehead of the Cossack, and he wavered
for a second, as if partially blinded. Only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a second, though, did his sword arm hesitate.
Schneider received another wound, this time close
to the throat.</p>

<p>"He's done for," tremulously whispered Henri,
wondering why the soldier onlookers did not interfere,
and eager to make a saving move himself.</p>

<p>Then, as though a whole row of wine glasses had
been riven by a knife stroke, the Cossack's blade,
cleft near the haft by a biting downward cut of the
saber, fell tinkling at his feet.</p>

<p>This was the last flare of Schneider's waning
strength, of which, however, the Cossack was apparently
unaware. He did not wait to meet an expected
heart thrust from the victor.</p>

<p>With a piercing yell, he turned, waved the sword
stump about his head, and leaped far out into the
void before him.</p>

<p>Schneider, on hand and knee, game, but all in,
as the saying is, mournfully shook his head, and
faintly murmured: "He would have had another
chance to finish."</p>

<p>Stanislaws, something of a surgeon, stanched the
blood welling from the wounds of his comrade, applied
bandages, and soon had the fallen fighter on
his feet.</p>

<p>The Cossack's mount had disappeared, a fact
first noticed by the acute Roque. "Mark you," he
predicted, "that riderless horse will be sure to stir
up a wasps' nest, and somebody here will get stung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
if we attempt to hold this position. Schneider's
punctures are enough for one day."</p>

<p>Roque's prediction was a sure shot, for he had
hardly ceased speaking when a score or more of
horsemen charged from the cover of a rocky defile
and bore down in force upon the aviation party.</p>

<p>"To your places!" thundered Roque.</p>

<p>The pilots of the several aëroplanes were already
making ready for hurried flight, and Henri, in addition,
had assisted the wounded and weakened
Schneider to his seat in their machine.</p>

<p>Breckens, Bishoff and Mendell emptied their carbines
and revolvers in the direction of the oncoming
lancers, clearing a saddle or two, and swung
into the rigging of the waiting biplanes just in time
to permit a clean getaway.</p>

<p>Right over the brink of the precipice the start
was made&mdash;it had to be the quickest way&mdash;and a
thousand feet of ascent gained without an upturn.</p>

<p>Circling about on high the soldier-observers scattered
the horsemen on the plateau with a shower
of bombs.</p>

<p>Schneider had had his innings, and returned in
full measure all that was owing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>DRAWN FROM THE DEPTHS.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Mr. Roque, if you did not get Filimonoff
this trip, you struck mighty close to him, for
I'll warrant the man whom Schneider vanquished
was a leader in the Cossack horde."</p>

<p>"And something of a fighter, you might add,
Stanislaws," rejoined the secret agent. "But there's
another day, and the kingpin and I may yet lock
horns."</p>

<p>The aviation party was again at Galician headquarters,
and the interesting invalid, Schneider, was
already declaring that he was as good as ever.</p>

<p>Roque had a grouch, chafing because of the delay
of the Austrian forces in getting through to the relief
of Przemysl.</p>

<p>"Just think what might be done if we had enough
flying machines, Zeppelins and aëroplanes, to bring
over an army corps every week or so." This idea
expressed by the ever-enthusiastic Stanislaws.</p>

<p>"You are not talking airship now, Stanny; it's
an air castle you have in mind."</p>

<p>This pleasantry on the part of Billy turned the
laugh on the Austrian aviator, in which he joined
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's one thing sure," finally declared Roque,
"I know of at least two airships that are soon to
sail over the heads of the Russians who are now
blocking the way to the fortress."</p>

<p>"I just knew he would be pushing something
across before long," said Henri to his chum.</p>

<p>"From the way he looked at us when he spoke,
it's safe to believe that we will be somewhere behind
the push."</p>

<p>Billy had a hunch that his job was secure whenever
Roque had work above ground.</p>

<p>Schneider had heard enough to set him at the
task of cleaning and polishing his personal stock
of firearms.</p>

<p>The four biplanes returned that very night to the
besieged fortress, from which two of the machines
were destined to leave in short order on a most important
and perilous journey.</p>

<p>Our boys had instructions to give the aircraft a
thorough going over, fill the petrol tanks to utmost
capacity, and carry all the condensed foodstuff possible.</p>

<p>"Maybe he is figuring on a chance of a lay-up in
the mountains," suggested Stanislaws, detailed to
assist the younger aviators in the work of preparation.</p>

<p>"'Maybe' is a good word to use in connection
with the moves of the chief, for you can't prove
anything by us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The present was all that counted with the busy
lads, hustling to complete their immediate assignment.</p>

<p>"Ready and waiting," they soon announced to the
chief, who simply nodded approval, and went on
with the work in which he was engaged&mdash;studying
and making field maps.</p>

<p>Henri put in the spare time afforded with continuous
instruction of his chum in the German language,
Billy having already acquired, by hard
knocks, talking knowledge of French. They were
thus occupied one morning, when Schneider appeared,
in war-like array, with brief order.</p>

<p>"Buckle up."</p>

<p>Roque found everything in shipshape for the getaway,
and smiled at the impatience of Schneider,
who had been stamping around the hangars since
the first glimpse of daylight.</p>

<p>While the young pilots were drawing to the elbows
their fleece-lined gauntlets, the secret agent
was earnestly assuring the commander of the garrison
of his belief that the way would very soon
open for the long-expected relieving force.</p>

<p>"I think I can advise them to good effect if we
get through in safety," he said, mounting his perch
in the biplane, and giving Billy the word to go.</p>

<p>As the biplanes shot through space, only Roque,
the directing power, had knowledge of their destination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
though Schneider inferred that the finish
would be somewhere in the thick of battle.</p>

<p>This inference was not far amiss, for when the
aircraft finally slackened speed, and stood still
against the blue vault of heaven, still as the condor
floating above his native mountains, the aviators
looked down upon a thick forest of bayonets, shown
on all sides by the square formation of the Austrian
forces, then endeavoring to pierce the Russian front
near Lupkow and thus relieve Przemysl.</p>

<p>"We are in the Carpathians," Schneider advised
his flying mate.</p>

<p>The fighting in these mountains had then been
continuous and intense for weeks, the two armies
contending desperately for the ridges, the possession
of which would give advantage to the holders.
Every concession of a few yards of the rocky slopes
had exacted heavy toll of lives.</p>

<p>Behind the Austrian lines at Lupkow the aviators
made landing, descending through a sea of smoke,
and amid deafening roar of furious conflict.</p>

<p>Roque had hasty conference with the commanding
officers, and outlined conditions at the great
underground fortress, to save which this day's engagement
had been planned.</p>

<p>Schneider and the boys had received orders from
their chief to stand by the aëroplanes, and on no account
to leave their posts.</p>

<p>"He evidently does not believe there is much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a show of smashing the Russian barrier to-day," observed
the firebrand, who little relished the infliction
of standing still in the rear while so much powder
was being burned in front.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent, the way the tide of battle
was turning, that the rear of the Austrian position
would not be such a lonesome place after all. Retreat
had begun, and immediately Roque emerged
from the ruck.</p>

<p>"This isn't our day," was the news he brought;
"get under way or you will get under foot."</p>

<p>It was a stirring scene that spread under the rising
biplanes, the massed formation attacks of the
Austrians hurled back again and again by the sheer
weight of the Russians, pouring men forward in
seemingly unending numbers.</p>

<p>"They're thicker than flies in Egypt," growled
Schneider, when his soldierly eye perceived that the
Austrians could no longer stand the pressure of the
numbers arrayed against them, and that the day was
lost.</p>

<p>The aviators decided to adopt the manner of the
eagle and nest high that night. They found a level
on a mountain peak not very far removed from the
clouds.</p>

<p>"You could cut the stillness up here with a
knife," asserted Billy, and his companions agreed
that there was a decided difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shell-rent territory from which they had just flown
and the awesome silence of this sublime height.</p>

<p>"It might also be mentioned that the cold on this
top could be sawed into chunks," put in Henri, taking
the precaution of covering the motor tanks with
blankets.</p>

<p>Schneider volunteered to skirmish for some material
with which to establish a campfire, while the
boys busied themselves in opening some of the tins
enclosing the food supply.</p>

<p>Roque found consolation in keeping alight a long
black cigar.</p>

<p>Presently he concluded to follow in the footsteps
of the wood hunter, and hasten the prospect of a
cheery blaze by the time night should fall.</p>

<p>With the passing of an hour or more, and no sign
of the fuel seekers, Billy and Henri developed an
uneasy streak, rendered more acute by the drear surroundings
and the oppressive lack of all sound.</p>

<p>"We had better do some scouting; I'll go daffy
with this waiting business."</p>

<p>"I'm with you, Billy," joined in Henri, "anything
but sitting 'round here doing nothing."</p>

<p>The boys lost no time in picking their way
through the rocks in the direction taken by their
absent companions.</p>

<p>"Let's give them a shout," suggested Billy, himself
acting first on the suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>No answer to the shouters, when they paused at
intervals, hoping for the welcome response.</p>

<p>Stumbling along, careless now of bumps and
bruises, the lads so often raised their voices to high
pitch that they were hoarse from the effort.</p>

<p>Rounding a huge boulder that blocked their path,
Billy, who was in the lead, suddenly started back
with a cry of alarm, and Henri instinctively threw
his arms about the waist of his chum.</p>

<p>Lucky move, this, for the Bangor boy was in the
closest kind of way connected with a mass of crumbling
earth that swept with a slight rumble into the
darksome depths of Uzsok pass.</p>

<p>Henri's strong pull landed both boys on their
backs&mdash;but on the safe side of the boulder.</p>

<p>"Narrow shave that, old boy," murmured Billy,
raising himself on his elbow, and reaching for the
hand of his chum, "and it's to you that I owe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of that," interrupted Henri, "it's only
a rare occasion when you were not doing something
for me. I think we can account now for the disappearance
of Roque and Schneider. It completely
unnerves me, though, to believe that our companions
are lost in this abyss."</p>

<p>Billy was on his feet in an instant, alert and resourceful.</p>

<p>"There's a way of finding out whether or not
they are down there, and we will never quit searching
as long as there's a speck of hope."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Gingerly skirting the boulder, he found solid
ground on the higher side, to the right of the treacherous
spot on which he had so narrowly escaped a
long fall.</p>

<p>Stretched out full length at the verge of the steep
descent, Billy peered into the depths, giving vent
to several ear-splitting whoops in rapid succession.</p>

<p>A faint halloo finally came back from the dim recesses
of the pass.</p>

<p>"Glory be!" cried the strenuous hailer, "there is
somebody below&mdash;and that somebody is alive!"
Through the hollow of his hands Billy shouted
words of encouragement to the unseen owner of
the voice answering from the bush-grown wall of
the chasm.</p>

<p>"It's a clear drop of twenty feet, and smooth as
a billiard ball before the growth begins and the rocks
shelve out," Billy advised his chum, the latter to
the rear and maintaining a firm grip on the ankles
of the venturesome prober of the pass mystery.</p>

<p>"Oh, for an hour more of daylight," lamented
Billy, as dusk began to envelop the lonely mountain.
"Gee! Why didn't I think of it before?" Imbued
with his new idea, he quickly swung around,
bounced to his feet, hauled Henri up by the wrists,
and triumphantly demanded:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with flying around there in
the machine?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's getting too dark now to see anything
in that hole," objected Henri.</p>

<p>"Where's your wits, Buddy? What do we carry
searchlights for?"</p>

<p>"I sure am a woodenpate," admitted Henri, using
a fist to tap his forehead; "let's go to the biplane
as fast as our legs will carry us."</p>

<p>The boys raced like mad for camp.</p>

<p>With every light available from both machines
set in one of the biplanes, fore and aft, the young
aviators sailed through the shadows, got their bearings
from the big rock and fearlessly swooped into
the lower strata.</p>

<p>The glittering gondola of the air trailed a line of
illumination along the rugged face of the chasm
wall, but in the first passing, Henri, as observed,
gave no signal of discovery.</p>

<p>The insistent hum of the motors prevented the
hearing of any hail that might be given from without,
and as effectually drowned any call from within
the machine.</p>

<p>"Another round, Billy boy," shouted Henri, "a
little lower down."</p>

<p>The next circle and come-back brought results,
attested by a gleeful hurrah from the observer.</p>

<p>"There's a man on the ledge over there&mdash;there's
two, by jingo! Round again, pard. Steady now!"</p>

<p>The aëroplane was dangerously near the ledge,
a little above it. Henri was standing, one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
gripping a stay for balance, and in the other grasping
a ball of whipcord. With a sharp turn the pilot
nosed away, the tail lights of the machine gleamed
full for an instant upon the dark figures silhouetted
on the rock face, and in that precious, fleeting instant,
with a round arm swing, Henri sent the cord
ball, unwinding as it dropped, straight down upon
the ledge.</p>

<p>"Up!" sang out the maker of the successful
throw, and as the biplane made almost perpendicular
ascent, it tugged, kite like, at a long line of cord,
paid out by one of the men left behind on the rocky
shelf.</p>

<p>Once out of the canyon, the pilot checked his
flight at the first level, and both boys, under the
glare of the searchlight, speedily spliced and knotted
two coils of fine-fibered rope, part of the flying
equipment.</p>

<p>Henri, leaning over the edge, drew the cord connection
taut, indicating to the holders below that all
was ready at the top. The boy felt sure that Roque
would understand&mdash;for it was Roque he had seen
in the circle of light when the ball was thrown.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the cord was drawn downward,
and the rope followed the cord, with, happily, plenty
to spare for the making of a safe and secure anchorage.</p>

<p>"Roque is something of a sailor, as we know, and
he'll come up all right, with a good purchase for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
feet against the wall. As for Schneider, the three
of us can hoist him, if necessary."</p>

<p>Billy's advance arrangement went somewhat
awry, for it was Schneider's red top showing first
in the light over the brink, and Roque was the one
hauled, almost a dead weight, to solid ground and
safety at the end of the swaying rope, looped under
his armpits.</p>

<p>The secret agent's right hand rested in an improvised
handkerchief sling, and his face was set in
the pallor of pain.</p>

<p>But how strangely gentle had grown the piercing
fixity of those hard-speaking eyes when turned upon
the rescuers who had dared so much in a feat wonderful
to record in aviation annals.</p>

<p>"You might have waited until daylight," he
chided, his voice freighted with emotion, "and with
less risk to yourselves."</p>

<p>"And the morning found a couple of maniacs cavorting
around this wilderness. No, sir, the rest
cure wouldn't have been the right prescription for
us. Eh, Henri?"</p>

<p>"He's as right as a trivet, Mr. Roque; we took
the proper tonic," assured Henri.</p>

<p>"A man's size swallow for all that," was Schneider's
amen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>A MIGHTY STONE ROLLER.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Careful</span> examination revealed that Roque's injury
was not of broken bones, but a severe sprain,
due to the twisting suspension from the bush which
had checked his fall. Schneider had gone down feet
foremost, breaking through the growth until he
struck the ledge.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect Mr. Roque so soon," he said,
with a face-wide grin, "but I knew him by his legs,
and gave him an open-arm reception."</p>

<p>"Until Schneider reached for me," related the
secret agent, "I thought there was nothing underneath
but the bottom of nowhere. It was certainly
a curious accident, all in all, the two of us tumbling
as we did, stopping in the very same place, and both
of us alive to tell it."</p>

<p>"There was mighty near a good third on your
peculiar track," interposed Henri, "for Billy had set
his heels for that very slide which you two took."</p>

<p>"If it had not been for Henri," asserted Billy,
"there is no telling how deep I would have gone."</p>

<p>"And if it had not been for both of you, there
was hardly more to look for than a miserable end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for Schneider and me. We could have proceeded
neither up nor down, for there was nothing to put
hand or toe into for many rods either way."</p>

<p>Roque did not propose that the boys should lose
any of their dues for gallant achievement by other
belief than that two lives had actually depended
upon their prowess.</p>

<p>When Schneider intimated that he thought it was
time for another attempt to find material for a fire,
there were two young rebels emphatically against
the proposition.</p>

<p>"We'll move where there is wood in sight," was
the joint declaration.</p>

<p>Roque agreed that a change of base was desirable,
and a flight from the mountain top was in immediate
order.</p>

<p>As the machines descended and followed a lower
course, ghastly reminders of the struggle that had
recently taken place in and along the pass were easily
discernible from the lookout seat of the biplanes&mdash;the
melting snow on the slopes revealing many
bodies of Austrians and Russians.</p>

<p>In a clearing at the edge of a considerable forest
the aëroplanes again settled, the observers being
first convinced that there was no military occupation,
especially hostile, of the wooded tract.</p>

<p>"This beats the mountain roost a mile and a
half," declared Billy, the leader in hopping out
of the aircraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In a big hole in the ground, dug by the impact
of a cannon ball, Schneider started a brush fire, and
in a few minutes was passing hot coffee around.</p>

<p>"I must say," observed Roque, between bites at
a sandwich of corned beef and hardtack, "that I
don't seem to be getting anywhere on this trip except
into pitfalls. All this is sheer waste of time.
I had hoped to see a relief march to Przemysl begun
within a day, but here we are tied in a knot,
and not a step forward."</p>

<p>"Well," consoled Schneider, "you gave them the
route that could be won with the least difficulty."</p>

<p>"But what's the good of that when the opening
wedge couldn't be driven?" impatiently queried
Roque.</p>

<p>Schneider scratched his head. He had no answer.</p>

<p>"There is one thing sure," exclaimed the secret
agent, "and that is, I must be on the move, for this
isn't the only fish scorching in the pan."</p>

<p>Billy just then edged into the conversation. He
had made an alarming discovery. The petrol supply
in the biplane tanks was at low mark. The
aviators had expected to replenish long before this,
and the disaster at Lupkow had spoiled their last
chance.</p>

<p>"Oil nearly out, sir," were the words that brought
Roque to his feet like a jumping-jack.</p>

<p>"The devil you say!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a quandary that completely upset the
chief.</p>

<p>"We ought to have filled day before yesterday,"
explained Billy, "but you know why we didn't."</p>

<p>"The only thing to do that I see," advanced
Henri, "is to add the supply of one machine to
that of the other, and two of us hunt for the new
camp of the Austrians."</p>

<p>"They could fix us all right," assured Schneider,
"for there is quite a number of aëroplanes with
the force which was driven back."</p>

<p>"It was my intent to get in touch once more with
this corps, but it was not my intent to divide this
party in the going. It cannot be helped, though,
and it may take but a few hours at most. You are
sure" (turning to Billy) "that you cannot raise
enough power for both motors to go the distance?"</p>

<p>"I fear, sir, that both machines would be
stranded in less than an hour; and, with all this uncertainty
as to how far we would have to go, there
is no telling into what kind of place and under
what circumstances we would be compelled to drop.
There would be much less odds against the one-machine
plan."</p>

<p>"It's up to you to prove it," challenged Roque,
"for you and I are going to make the trial."</p>

<p>The transfer of the petrol accomplished, Schneider
and Henri were left in sole possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
camp in the woods, after a last strained look at the
departing biplane, a little blot on the sky, finally
dissolving in the mist of the mountain top.</p>

<p>"Let's knock about a bit," said Schneider, suiting
action to the words by starting up the nearest
slope, where the gloomy pines were farther apart
than in the dense growth below.</p>

<p>"Ah! Here's where the Russians must have gotten
a severe jolt. See here, my young friend"&mdash;Schneider
pointing at a scattered ground array of
discarded rifles, knapsacks, sheepskin coats, and
many caisson shells in baskets. "Not so very long
ago, either, for you will notice that all this is on
the top of the snow and not under it. You can
safely wager that here, and at this season, it is not
very long between snows."</p>

<p>Here and there were other objects, stiff and stark,
that sent a shudder up Henri's spine.</p>

<p>Picking their way still higher to the apex of the
ridge, the man and boy had view of a land depression,
bowl shaped, almost cleared of snow by exposure
to the sun, being free of shade or shadow.</p>

<p>Something on the far side of the bowl, catching
a golden ray from above, glittered like a big diamond.
Henri called Schneider's attention to the
flashing point.</p>

<p>"Worth a walk across," conceded the soldier-aviator,
moving that way. Henri, interest aroused,
made it a point to outpace his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Drawing nearer, the investigators saw, in half-sitting
posture, back against a blanket roll, a soldier&mdash;in
dark-blue uniform, Austrian infantry&mdash;marked
by emblems of rank, including a sparkling decoration
on the breast.</p>

<p>A silver flask lay close by, alongside of sword
and belt.</p>

<p>Schneider dropped to his knees, seized one of the
nerveless hands of the officer, and fingered the pulse
of the lifted wrist. The old campaigner had noted
that the blood curdle in a tunic fold was yet unfrozen.</p>

<p>"Hand me that flask."</p>

<p>Henri quickly complied with his comrade's request,
first unscrewing the metal top. Schneider
tenderly moved the head of the officer to his own
shoulder and poured the contents of the flask
through the livid lips.</p>

<p>"He lives!" cried Schneider.</p>

<p>The evidence was a faint flutter of the eyelids, a
twitching of fingers and labored breathing.</p>

<p>Henri unrolled the blanket that served as a backrest,
made a pillow of the wounded soldier's knapsack,
and Schneider shifted his burden to this new
resting place.</p>

<p>It was not long until the vigorous first aid rendered
by the aviators found a more marked response&mdash;the
heretofore unconscious officer looked
up at the anxious faces of the workers, and perceptibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
smiled through the beard that concealed his
mouth.</p>

<p>He had comprehended that he did not owe a
Russian for the help that had come to him in this
extremity.</p>

<p>Schneider addressed him in the familiar tongue
of the Fatherland, and Henri also added a word of
sympathy and encouragement in the same tongue,
at the time bending his head in the hope of a word
in reply.</p>

<p>That word was spoken, and others in faltering
train.</p>

<p>"He says his name is Schwimmer, Johann
Schwimmer&mdash;captain."</p>

<p>"A captain without a regiment," was Schneider's
sad comment, his eyes bending further afield, where
corpses in blue, in heaps and singly, marked the
path of deadly artillery practice.</p>

<p>"It does look as if we are caring for the only
survivor," said Henri, realizing that Schneider's
mournful observation was founded upon fact.</p>

<p>That Captain Schwimmer understood what was
passing between his rescuers was manifest, for stoic
though he was, he covered his eyes with a trembling
hand and his breast heaved convulsively.</p>

<p>At the moment there was a startling diversion&mdash;the
whip-like crack of rifles from the opposite edge
of the bowl, at the very point where the aviators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
had stood when first attracted by the shining point
on the captain's tunic.</p>

<p>Spat, spat&mdash;bullets boring the earth close to the
right, left, and at the very feet of the trio on the
ridge.</p>

<p>Schneider, again a firebrand without sentiment,
coolly unslung the carbine from his shoulder, and
put a shot across that evidently counted, for it raised
a death-yell.</p>

<p>Without further ado, the soldier-airman plumped
down on the ground, with his back to the sufferer
on the blanket, and hoisted upon his broad shoulders
the sorely wounded soldier, who faintly protested,
and urged Schneider not to so hamper himself.</p>

<p>But you might as well argue with the wind; the
sorrel-top warrior was up and away, making little
of his load, Henri sprinting at his heels.</p>

<p>The firing company of Russians, either stragglers
from the rear of a corps or scouts in advance of
one, had evidently no intention of permitting the
escape of several prospective prisoners, and they
took up the chase as eagerly as the sporting pursuers
of a deer, whooping and shooting as they bounded
in a body across the separating hollow.</p>

<p>But for the good start made, Schneider could
not have possibly, extra-weighted as he was, maintained
speed enough to have gained even the base
of the mountain for which he was heading. As it
resulted, the carrier and the carried had hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
reached the first level, some fifty feet up, when the
Muscovite marksmen were in close target range,
and a leaden pellet among the many flattening
against the rocks clipped the visor of Henri's cap
as he cast a last look at the oncoming crowd before
climbing like a squirrel into the rocky shelter
above.</p>

<p>Schneider had placed Captain Schwimmer out of
any possible line of fire from below, and was doing
some return shooting on his own account. Unluckily
for this style of defense, all of the surplus
ammunition was in the locker of the biplane back
in the woods, and the few rounds in the aviator's
pockets were soon exhausted.</p>

<p>Henri knew that such was the situation by the
fervid remarks of his companion.</p>

<p>But such was the angle of the aviators' perch that
there could be no attack except from the front, and
even that was a climbing approach.</p>

<p>It occurred to Henri, considering the lay of the
land, that lead was not the only effective substance
with which to repel boarders.</p>

<p>The ground was loaded with natural ammunition&mdash;loose
rocks and rocks, thousands of them, from
fist size up to a ton.</p>

<p>"Hey, old scout," hailed the boy, "give them a
dose of dornicks."</p>

<p>Schneider took the hint with a burst of approbation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two heads are better than one," he facetiously
declared, hauling off his greatcoat for greater freedom
as a heaver.</p>

<p>A dozen or more of the pursuing party were
working up the acute elevation when the first huge
stone thundered down the incline. The boulder
made as clean a sweep as a well-placed ball in a
bunch of ninepins.</p>

<p>"A ten-strike!" whooped Schneider. "Set 'em
up again in the other alley!"</p>

<p>The Russians back-tracked for a time, finding a
better range to fire at the defenders on the mountainside,
and such was the fusillade that Schneider
and Henri were compelled to stay in cover to save
their skins.</p>

<p>"They can't work that game, though, to support
a scaling force," said Schneider, "for the same fire
would catch the scalers. If they come any nearer
we can fix them, all right. But what a mercy it is
that they haven't a field gun with them."</p>

<p>"As it is, we can't stave them off very long,"
added Henri. "When it gets dark the stone-rolling
game won't work."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, young man, when that hour
comes, all they'll find here will be an empty nest."</p>

<p>The veteran had a moving plan up his sleeve, and
the chief reason he had for making this stand was
to give the injured captain a little more time to
mend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>A scalp wound was what had laid the officer low,
and since recovering consciousness he had rallied
remarkably. In the soldier's knapsack, which Henri
had thoughtfully carried, notwithstanding the hasty
leave-taking, was three days' rations, and the invalid
had also been strengthened by the food his
new friends prevailed upon him to swallow.</p>

<p>During the day Schneider several times checked
an effort of their foes to reach the height by starting
a little avalanche of rocks at the critical moment.</p>

<p>In the periods of enforced peace, he cast an eye
about for a likely way for quick retreat.</p>

<p>The way presented itself in the shape of a fallen
pine that bridged a narrow pass, deeply dividing
this isolated level from the mountain chain that
widely extended back of the occupied position, and
rose in serried crags to the very skyline.</p>

<p>It was a nerve-testing prospect, alluring alone to
a professional rope walker.</p>

<p>"We'll tackle it in short order," resolutely declared
Schneider, after final survey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>TRAILS THAT CROSSED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the biplane bearing Chief Roque and
Billy Barry cleared the mountain top, the pilot and
observer had a fixed understanding that every Russian
camp was to be given a wide berth, for with
fuel tanks going dry it would have been the top of
folly to invite a long chase from the Muscovite
airmen. And then, too, it was no part of a safe
and sane program to risk an enforced descent in
hostile domain.</p>

<p>"Keep her nose southward," commanded Roque,
"and we may find the Austrian lines before we have
lost our power. It's a desperate chance, of course,
but there is nothing else to be done."</p>

<p>A precious hour was consumed in fruitless flight,
with never a cheering sign of the friendly forces
sought by the anxious aviators.</p>

<p>"It has just dawned upon me that our army has
again entrenched in the mountains, for we could
not possibly have come so far in the open without
a single sight that would encourage further search
in this direction."</p>

<p>Roque trained his glasses to the east, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
snow-capped peaks of the Carpathians were showing
in the dim distance.</p>

<p>"It's a good forty miles in that turn," figured
Billy, "and whether we can make it or not with an
inch or two of petrol is a close guess."</p>

<p>"Make a try for it, and count on the wind to
help."</p>

<p>The mind of the chief was set on this last throw.</p>

<p>One satisfaction to Billy in this change of course
was the definite objective&mdash;hit or miss, they were
no longer wandering.</p>

<p>Within a mile of the first slope the pilot knew that
the jig was up with the motors. Over his shoulder,
he called to the observer:</p>

<p>"This is no Zeppelin with a gas range, and it's
the turf for us now."</p>

<p>The motors clanked and ceased to hum. The
aëroplane took the downshoot and skated to a
standstill on the slippery soil.</p>

<p>"Stranded but not wrecked."</p>

<p>Roque accepted the inevitable with fairly good
grace for him.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?"</p>

<p>Billy was curious to know what the chief had in
stock for the emergency.</p>

<p>The boy was not immediately enlightened, for
Roque evidently proposed to reach speech through
meditation. The secret agent with his long coat-tail
dusted the powdery snow from a flat stone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
calmly took his ease behind the glowing tip of a
long cigar.</p>

<p>"He must have wireless communication with a
tobacco shop," thought Billy, "for he never fails to
find one of those black rolls when he reaches for it."</p>

<p>The young pilot, muffled in a blanket, stuck to
his seat in the biplane. It was his fortune, however,
to see the first rift in their clouded luck.</p>

<p>The color scheme of the mountain side, brown,
white and gray, added in the passing minute some
new and stirring effects. On a higher slope were
arrayed a number of men wearing crest helmets,
blue jackets and red trousers.</p>

<p>"Say, boss," drawled Billy, when he caught sight
of these gorgeous figures, "there's a circus band
coming down the mountains."</p>

<p>Roque looked up. "Austrian dragoons!" he exclaimed.
"We've rung the bell this time!"</p>

<p>Whether or not the dragoons heard Roque's exultant
remarks, they were, nevertheless, gazing at
and pointing to the spot where the stranded aviators
were joyfully anticipating discovery. Willing to
aid it, indeed, upstanding and waving welcome.</p>

<p>The soldiers came in haste to size up the strangely
arrived visitors, and the leader recognized Roque
as an oft-seen mixer in official circles. In calling
him by name, however, the name was not "Roque."</p>

<p>The secret agent promptly explained the situation,
and received hearty assurance that he could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
enough petrol to carry him back to Berlin, if he
wanted that much.</p>

<p>"We have fifteen air cruisers with us," stated the
dragoon spokesman. "By the way, who is your
pilot? You must have plucked him young."</p>

<p>Billy, notwithstanding Henri's patient instruction,
was a little short yet in the Teuton tongue, but
he had picked out of the conversation at this stage
enough to put him wise to the fact that he was in
the limelight.</p>

<p>"A bud as to years, I'll admit, my dear lieutenant,
but in genius, skill and daring a full flower;
one of the master craftsmen of the flying profession,
and I left a companion piece on the other side
of the mountain."</p>

<p>Threading Roque's eloquent tribute no doubt
was the memory of that most recent rescue performance
of the Boy Aviators in the black pass of
Uzsok.</p>

<p>The boy from Bangor felt like the bashful member
of a graduating class when the dragoons committed
friendly assault by slapping him between the
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Roten will steal you," laughingly predicted one
of them. Billy later discovered that Roten was the
chief aviator at army headquarters.</p>

<p>It was decided by Roque that Billy and himself
should rejoin Henri and Schneider at once, the reunited
party returning together to this camp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
remaining until the development of new plans of the
secret agent.</p>

<p>Roten suggested that as it was the intent of the
aviation corps to inaugurate a reconnoitering expedition
the following day, it would be of mutual
pleasure and benefit to combine in the trip. Further,
he advised Roque of a much more direct route
over the mountains than the roundabout way uncertainly
taken by the secret agent in coming.</p>

<p>"Consent"&mdash;this ready acceptance by Roque.</p>

<p>The army air scouts who were to participate in
the expedition numbered eight, and the No. 3 piloted
by Billy would measure speed with four of the
swiftest biplanes in this branch of the service.</p>

<p>To the east of the Uzsok pass the Russians had
constructed an elaborate network of cement and
earthwork trenches, and to make any headway
against the vigorous Muscovite defense at this point
the Austrian troops would encounter a particularly
difficult task.</p>

<p>It was up to the Austrian aviation corps to determine
the true strength of the position, and to
weigh the chances of an assault with the present artillery
equipment in support.</p>

<p>So it happened that the little fleet was going in
just the right direction to enable Roque to reunite
his own party, at the same time affording him the
opportunity to see for himself what was going on.</p>

<p>Roten had been fully advised of the exact location<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in the pass of the forest tract where Schneider
and Henri were supposed to be watching for the return
of their companions.</p>

<p>"We will find it without fail," he confidently declared,
"and taking the nearest way there."</p>

<p>A blinding snowstorm, beginning in the night,
served to hold the aviators in shelter for another
day. At the first sign of clearing weather, however,
Roten decided to fly, though he explained that many
landmarks would be lost sight of under the drifts,
markings recorded during a previous journey.</p>

<p>"Follow the compass, old man."</p>

<p>This remark, ventured by one of the lieutenants,
the chief airman ignored with a sniff.</p>

<p>"Pass the word to pull out," he snapped.</p>

<p>Five biplanes were off at the signal, and winging
their way in perfect alignment. As far as vision
extended billows upon billows of snow capped the
mountaintops and billows and billows of it smothered
the defiles. The observers shaded their eyes as
best they could with their hoods from the trying
color effect, heightened by the reflection of the sun,
and many times the pilots made hasty swipes with
coat cuffs to dry wet cheeks.</p>

<p>Roten changed the course more than once during
the first hour out, indicating that he was missing
here and there some familiar formation that would
aid the keeping of undeviating progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ought to get to the jumping-off place pretty
soon at fifty miles an hour."</p>

<p>Billy felt that he had to say something to break
the sailing monotony.</p>

<p>If Roque had an opinion he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>There was one thing sure, the flight had carried
the aviators beyond the path of the recent blizzard,
for brown and gray were again showing above the
white in the checkered landscape.</p>

<p>That Roten was planning an intermission was
apparent by the circling action of his machine over
a plateau of broad expanse, probably an intermediate
station with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p>His initiative set the balance of the flock on the
down grade, and the pilots rejoiced over the immediate
prospect of a thaw-out.</p>

<p>The chief aviator wore a satisfied smile on his
bewhiskered countenance. "The Carpathians were
never built to down me," he briskly proclaimed;
"we'll go to the mark now like a bullet through
cheese as soon as the steering boys get the cricks
out of their backs."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," volunteered Billy, "it is a
tolerably nifty morning to hold a still curve for a
hundred and twenty minutes at a stretch."</p>

<p>Roten, who understood American, grinned appreciatively
at this recognition of his welfare action
in behalf of the pilots.</p>

<p>"Right over there, Mr. Roque," he continued, indicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a summit a quarter of a mile distant, "is
a rise exactly on a line west from where you started
the other day to hunt for petrol&mdash;some twenty
miles or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"You ought to have a medal for accuracy, my
friend," genially complimented Roque, "and I apologize
for holding the suspicion at least once to-day
that the snow had thrown you out of balance."</p>

<p>"Can't blame you much, sir; I was mizzled a bit
by too much white shroud back there. But here
comes Ansel with the oil stove and the coffee pot,
and we will have a brew that will reach all the cold
spots under the vest."</p>

<p>"You must have been born for this kind of business,"
piped Billy, viewing the food display on a
blanket laid like a tablecloth and the steaming coffee
pot topping the little camp stove.</p>

<p>"I have had some experience in living in and out
of an aëroplane," modestly admitted Roten, "yet
I have seen days when I wished that I hadn't been
born for this profession; hungry days, never-resting
days, ever-perilous days. A sailor may be saved
from shipwreck, a soldier has a fighting chance on
the ground, but when an aëroplane goes too far
wrong, just save the pieces, that's all."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir," earnestly declared Billy;
"but get it in the blood once and there's no quitting."</p>

<p>"By the way, speaking of military aviation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the cold we have endured to-day, it is no more a
question of climate in that sort of work. Why,
Russia is away up in the hundreds in the number of
its aircraft."</p>

<p>"I expect that is true, Mr. Roque; I know I have
met a few from over there myself," grimly conceded
Roten.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some that you will never meet again,"
suggested the secret agent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the veteran airman, reputed to
have been mixed up in as many air duels as there
were weeks in the year.</p>

<p>Billy, chumming it with Ansel, Roten's pilot,
had challenged the new friend for a footrace, which
led the runners to the edge of the plateau on the
north.</p>

<p>Looking across the intervening defile, their attention
was attracted by a movement on the opposite
slope, the first sign of life below observed since
they took flight from the Austrian camp early that
morning.</p>

<p>"There is something doing over there," panted
Billy, not yet recovered from the exertion of beating
his companion a foot or two in their speed contest.</p>

<p>"I can't tell what it is, though," replied Ansel in
broken English.</p>

<p>"It might be a bear," surmised Billy.</p>

<p>"More than one bear, then," claimed the Austrian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
"for I just saw two of the kind between the bushes."</p>

<p>"Your eyes are the better," conceded the boy;
"there are two, one with a big hump on its back.
I wish we could get over there."</p>

<p>Ansel shook his head. "You can't cross there on
foot. Too deep."</p>

<p>"We can chase back and get the glasses anyhow."</p>

<p>Billy was already on the way for the means of
satisfying his curiosity.</p>

<p>When the boy had secured the glasses and was
hastening by the group around the little stove,
Roque hailed him.</p>

<p>"What are you up to now?"</p>

<p>"Just going to take a pike at some mountain freak
on the other side of the gully."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, young man; I'll come and see
what you have started." Roque carried a big bump
of curiosity under his cap.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Ansel had told Roten about the
slope climbers, whatever they were, and the aviation
leader concluded that any sort of investigation
on this trip required his presence.</p>

<p>The whole company, then, trailed after Billy
across the plateau, with a general view of deciding
in force the value of the alleged discovery.</p>

<p>From the lookout point a battery of glasses were
soon trained upon the slope designated by Billy
and Ansel.</p>

<p>Roten hit the moving mark first this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be blest," he ejaculated, behind the steady
aim of the binocle, "if it isn't one big man carrying
another on his shoulders, and a shorter fellow bringing
up the rear!"</p>

<small>RABBIT'S FOOT FOR LUCK.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an hour the Russians in front of the rocky
rise, where Schneider and Henri stood sentinel over
the prostrate Austrian officer, had maintained an
ominous silence.</p>

<p>Not a shot had been fired in the mentioned time,
and no opportunity had been afforded the champion
stone roller to make another ten-strike in repulsing
attack.</p>

<p>"You can put it in your pipe and smoke it that
this brooding over there means no good to us."</p>

<p>While Henri was not addicted to the pipe, he accepted
the figure of speech, and fully agreed with
his companion that the calm had sinister portent.</p>

<p>"The minute is about ripe," he volunteered, "for
us to make ourselves scarce."</p>

<p>That Schneider was in accord with the proposition
had evidence in the action of removing his
boots. To cross a cavity that lowered two hundred
feet or more on the unstable and untried support
of a fallen pine warranted every precaution. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
could be no crawling for the venturesome bricktop.
He had human freight to carry on his back.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, captain," he apologized
to the invalid soldier, "but it has to be done."</p>

<p>Henri, keeping watch at the front, sounded a
note of alarm:</p>

<p>"Quick! I see what they're doing&mdash;it's a spread,
and a three-cornered charge&mdash;they've stolen to the
bushes right and left, and the firing gang in the middle
is prepared to pot us if we show head or hand!"</p>

<p>Schneider bent to the task of lifting Schwimmer,
the latter groaning at the movement.</p>

<p>Henri, balanced by Schneider's boots thonged
over one shoulder and the knapsack swinging from
the other, made a dash for the slender bridge. He
had determined to first essay the perilous passage,
and test the solidity required to bear the fourfold
weight that would follow.</p>

<p>A single misstep, and for the error maker there
yawned a pit of death, a mangling on jagged rocks
lashed by the ice-laden rush of a brawling mountain
stream.</p>

<p>But, sure-footed as the native chamois, with never
a falter nor a backward look, the boy made the
crossing, backed against the mound of upturned
earth in which the roots of the fallen pine were imbedded,
and fixed apprehensive eyes upon the burdened
Schneider bravely and steadily advancing
over the shaking bridge. Once the boy fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that, with the earth clods tumbling from the mound
behind, the whole structure was about to give, and
he instinctively reached out for what would have
been a vain endeavor to prevent the threatened disaster.</p>

<p>A moment later, with mingled sighs of exertion
and relief, the man and boy clasped hands&mdash;on solid
ground once more. The wounded officer had not
realized other than that he suffered by the necessary
lifting of his nerve-racked body.</p>

<p>Hardly a second, though, for the silent congratulation.
On the level the defenders had just quitted
in such thrilling manner swarmed Russian pursuers,
seeking with fierce activity those who had
conducted baffling resistance for several hours.</p>

<p>"Hear them yell," said Henri in suppressed tone.</p>

<p>"It's a sound better for the distance."</p>

<p>As Schneider made this comment he set shoulder
against the root-threaded mound that anchored the
fallen pine. With cracking of straining sinew the
powerful pusher put every ounce of his wonderful
strength into the effort of dislodgment. Thrice
he failed, and then, with a tearing, grinding give,
the mass loosened; another heave, and, as the perspiring
giant threw himself backward, just escaping
the void, the great trunk left its moorings and
crashed with a tremendous shower of soil and stone
into the abyss.</p>

<p>Schneider in a jiffy, and breathing like a porpoise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
dragged on his boots, again picked up the feebly
remonstrating captain, and led Henri a merry chase
around a rocky bend into the bush-grown level tabled
between this and the next mountainous range.</p>

<p>Finally halting, and now beyond hearing of the
whoops of the discomfited Russians, apprised of the
escape of their prey by the crashing fall of the old
pine, Schneider indulged in a cheer on his own account.</p>

<p>"Tough sledding, my boy, but a clean pair of
heels to the gentlemen with the sheepskin overcoats.
I don't know what's coming next, yet we can count
on a 'next' coming."</p>

<p>Henri had to put in a sad word, owing to the depletion
of the food store&mdash;the knapsack contained
less than two days' rations for one man.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two aviators met in meaning
glance&mdash;meaning that the remaining food should all
be reserved for the ailing soldier, now sleeping
quietly in his blanket roll.</p>

<p>Many a time in the hours of weary tramping did
the aviators tighten their belts, but without a single
utterance of complaint or bemoaning of sad
fate. To the gnawings of hunger happily were not
added the torments of thirst. Snow and ice served
that desire.</p>

<p>The rations were sparingly fed to the invalid,
who, unsuspicious of the sacrifice of his slowly
starving companions, appeared to be gaining a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of strength. He expressed sorrow that he must
so burden Schneider in the march, noting that the
latter had begun to occasionally stumble and stagger
under the load.</p>

<p>"Don't you bother a bit, captain," as often assured
the valiant aviator, "we will run into a
friendly camp before long, and you will be in fighting
trim before the moon changes again."</p>

<p>On the quiet to Henri, however, the big fellow
confided that rest hours must lengthen if he had to
fare much farther as a carrier.</p>

<p>He had discovered that in one of his revolvers
there were still two cartridges that had not been
exploded, and this find was due to the intention of
throwing away these weapons as useless and cumbersome
and a lucky farewell inspection of the
long-possessed arms.</p>

<p>Schneider was a famous shot, with these same
pistols had won several trophies, and, too, in war
service had with them seldom failed to stop an antagonist
lusting for his own life.</p>

<p>"Two bullets and three human lives at stake," he
mused, weighing the revolver in his right hand,
and aiming it at some imaginary living target.
Several times during the day both Henri and himself
had noted hare tracks in the snow, and Schneider
even talked in a hopeful way of rigging up
some sort of trap in the night. While the boy was
inclined to be doubtful as to their possible success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
as trappers, under the circumstances, he did not
spoil sport, in the mind of his companion, by adverse
argument.</p>

<p>Now there was something tangible in the anticipation
that Schneider might stalk and shoot a rabbit,
and so hearten the weakened wayfarers to renew
the battle for existence. They were beginning
to lag with every additional mile traversed.</p>

<p>"Here is a good place to rest," announced Henri,
whose sharp eyes had marked the mouth of a cave
among the bushes covering the sides of the ridge,
along which line the footsore travelers had been
continuously plodding for an hour or more.</p>

<p>"We can't stop too quick to suit me," said Schneider,
easing his living burden to the ground.</p>

<p>The cave was shallow, but ample in dimensions
for the three invaders, clean and dry, and containing
a quantity of dried moss.</p>

<p>Comfortably placing the invalid, Schneider
dropped like a log in his tracks. He was completely
exhausted, and knew no more of discomfort or the
waking world until roused by Henri vigorously tugging
at his coat sleeve. "There's game in sight,"
excitedly whispered the boy, "bring your revolver;
crawl, and don't make any noise!"</p>

<p>The suddenly awakened sleeper rubbed his eyes,
and, comprehending what was wanted, instantly produced
the trusty shooting iron, and as quickly
crawled to the mouth of the cave. Henri pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a trembling hand to the little clearing a few yards
below them.</p>

<p>Several hares, pure white, were hopping about,
scratching and burrowing in the brown loam, there
free of snow.</p>

<p>Schneider had for a second an attack of nerves,
similar to that fever in the amateur Nimrod when
first blundering upon the wallow of a buck deer.</p>

<p>Henri gave the shaking marksman a poke in the
ribs.</p>

<p>"Shoot, old scout, or give me the gun!"</p>

<p>By the poke and the hissed demand, Schneider
was himself again.</p>

<p>He drew bead on the nearest hare, and with the
puff of smoke from the revolver muzzle the little
animal made a frantic leap, ending in a complete
somersault and an inert heap of fur. Another
whiplike crack&mdash;and over went a second rabbit,
stopped on the first jump to cover.</p>

<p>"Another cartridge or two and I would have
potted the lot," boasted Schneider, "but even a pair
of them is a mighty big draw for us."</p>

<p>Henri missed these remarks, for he was Johnny-on-the-spot
to retrieve the game.</p>

<p>The pistol practice had startled Captain Schwimmer
from a doze, and he was under impression that
his friends were fighting off another attack by the
Russians. The captain had begun to take notice
of and interest in what was going on about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Raising himself on his elbows, he saw the result
of the shooting match in the pair of plump bunnies
swinging across Henri's shoulder when the boy capered
into the cave.</p>

<p>It occurred to the captain to inspect the knapsack
upon which his head had been pillowed. "Is this
all the food in the camp?" he questioned, handling
the few scraps in the sack.</p>

<p>Henri nodded in the affirmative, taken unawares
by the quick query.</p>

<p>"And I have been eating my fill regularly on this
march, have I not?"</p>

<p>"I hope you have not been hungry, captain,"
evaded Henri, realizing that the officer was putting
two and two together.</p>

<p>"I see it all now," exclaimed the invalid, "you
two have starved yourselves that I might live."</p>

<p>"Shucks, captain, don't put it that way: the rations
were yours in the first place, and, besides,
look at the glorious feast we're all going to have."</p>

<p>Henri's attempt to lightly pass the soldier's revolt
against the self-denial practiced by Schneider
and himself resulted only in the invalid turning face
downward on the nearly empty knapsack, his emotion
shown by convulsive movement between the
shoulders.</p>

<p>Schneider, wise unto himself, had kept out of
the discussion, and had practically contributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the settlement of the hunger question by neatly skinning
and cleaning the hare meat.</p>

<p>A hasty fire of dried moss and twigs and Schneider's
big knife utilized as a spit raised a savory
odor in the cave, and the picking of one set of bones
that evening helped a lot to revive courage and hope.
The captain, "by the doctor's orders," was compelled
to accept his share.</p>

<p>The other hare made the breakfast for the third
day out. Schneider alleged that he had a hunch
that this rabbit business had turned the scale of
luck, and to insure the belief he carefully pocketed
the left hind foot of one of the animals.</p>

<p>During the morning the pedestrians, rested and
fed, moved in fine style for the first few miles,
Schneider stoutly holding to the efficacy of a rabbit's
foot as a luck producer.</p>

<p>At the foot of the summit finally cutting off the
level over which the party had been so long traveling,
it was in order to do some climbing.</p>

<p>"It will give us a chance to look around," cheerfully
observed Henri, "and which chance isn't coming
to us down here."</p>

<p>Halfway up the height the boy was again heard
from. He insisted that he had seen a flock of eagles
in the western sky.</p>

<p>"Eagles your foot," bantered Schneider; "whoever
saw a flock of eagles?"</p>

<p>"Wild geese, then," insisted Henri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"How many did you see?" quizzed Schneider.</p>

<p>"Five or six, maybe."</p>

<p>"Guess again," laughed the big fellow; "geese
would be lonesome if that was all in a flight."</p>

<p>"Have it any way you please; I suppose you will
be claiming next that I am suffering with liver
spots."</p>

<p>Henri was a bit nettled that Schneider did not
take seriously his sky story.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes later, Henri called another
halt. "Now, old scout," he cried triumphantly,
"just look up for yourself and say what you would
call 'em."</p>

<p>Schneider, shading his eyes under a hand,
scanned the blue expanse above. "By the great
hornspoon," he almost shouted, "I believe they're
aëroplanes!"</p>

<p>Henri was more than willing to be convinced that
such was the fact.</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, captain?"</p>

<p>Schwimmer had from the first joined in the sky-gazing
contest.</p>

<p>"I think our friend Schneider has solved the
problem. I never saw a real bird with exactly that
motion."</p>

<p>The blots on the sky were increasing in size.</p>

<p>"It's a sure thing," hurrahed Henri, "and they're
circling for a landing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they're Russians," mildly suggested the
captain.</p>

<p>"Not while I'm carrying this rabbit's foot," firmly
asserted Schneider.</p>

<small>WINNING OF THE IRON CROSS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> aviators in the party of Roten were all for
sailing, post-haste, to the slope where the mysterious
climbers had been sighted, and very shortly the little
fleet was in the air, headed that way.</p>

<p>Flying low, the observers kept a sharp lookout
for the near appearance of the man with the burden
and the "shorter fellow."</p>

<p>Roque caught the first glimpse, and called to his
pilot to risk a look for himself. Billy had only a
side glance, as the machine rounded the summit,
but that was enough for him.</p>

<p>"It's Henri and Schneider, or their ghosts!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>Roque fixed his glasses for the close view.</p>

<p>"As sure as shooting it is, but how in the world
did they get here?"</p>

<p>Billy had no ear for this&mdash;he was for landing
right there, even with a chance of plowing through
the bushes. However, reason ruled, and he steered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
for a clearing, into which the biplane promptly
plumped.</p>

<p>Hardly waiting until the machine had run its
length, the boy was out and speeding to greet his
chum.</p>

<p>It was a regular collision, the manner in which
the youngsters came together.</p>

<p>"Glory be!" This was Billy's high-pitched note.</p>

<p>"Here's to you, Buddy, bully old boy!" Henri
cried.</p>

<p>The "bully old boy" then made a dash for Schneider
and worked the latter's brawny arm up and
down like a pump handle.</p>

<p>Roque repeated the last-named performance with
both the recovered members of his crew.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Austrians were saluting Captain
Schwimmer, well known to them as a gallant
officer in a famous command.</p>

<p>"But for them, gentlemen," gravely stated the
captain, nodding toward Schneider and Henri, "I
had been in my last fight. Through danger, cold
and hunger have they brought me, and neither needs
a patent of nobility&mdash;nature took care of that."</p>

<p>Roque had only to listen to the happy reunion
chatter of the boys to get the side of the story he
wanted to hear.</p>

<p>"It seems," he commented, "that Billy and I were
not in the same class this time with these trouble
hunters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose that there is anything left of
our biplane?"</p>

<p>Henri had taken on the air of a sea captain who
had lost his ship.</p>

<p>"That is an important question," said Roque,
"There is only one fit mate to that craft in this part
of the country."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the preservation of good feeling,
Roten did not hear this latter statement.</p>

<p>It was necessary to detail two corporal aviators
to take the wounded captain back to army headquarters,
where he could have the skilled surgical
attention that would hasten his recovery.</p>

<p>As the invalid was lifted into the machine that
was to do ambulance service, he gave a hand each
to Henri and Schneider.</p>

<p>"From my heart I thank you both," were his
last words in profoundly earnest farewell.</p>

<p>Henri traveled as a passenger with Billy and
Roque in the brief journey to the forest station
in the pass where it was hoped to find intact the
stranded biplane.</p>

<p>Schneider, who had been given a lift by Roten
in the trip, was in high glee when it developed that
the No. 3, behind its screen of bushes, had sustained
no damage.</p>

<p>"See that?" The big fellow held aloft the rabbit's
foot. "There's no jinx that can beat it."</p>

<p>Roque was delighted to learn, as the aërial expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
proceeded, that one of his cherished desires
had matured&mdash;a large German contingent had arrived
to support the determined effort of the Austrian
forces to relieve the Przemysl fortress.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind that it was well worth
the risk to carry back the new word of hope to
the hemmed in garrison, and Roten was informed
of his purpose.</p>

<p>"I regret that you must quit us, Mr. Roque," said
the aviation chief, "but it's the big thing you are
going to do, and I certainly wish the best for your
undertaking. Let me advise, however, that not a
screw should be loose when you make that dash.
You can't fall in that country now without bumping
a Russian."</p>

<p>"I'll back my boys to make the riffle," confidently
asserted Roque.</p>

<p>"They'll need the keen eye every inch of the
way," persisted Roten.</p>

<p>"We came out safely, and I guess we can repeat,"
declared the secret agent.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, sir, and look out for the big
guns at Malkovista; the Russians are there now,
and it's only three miles from Przemysl."</p>

<p>"We've come into our own again." Billy and
Henri were standing together, viewing with satisfaction
the graceful lines of the No. 3's, every part
adjusted to a nicety. Both boys were well aware
that they were to run a through express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Schneider had been supplied by a brother aviator
with a new outfit of firearms, and, as usual, was
spoiling for an uproar.</p>

<p>"Going, going, gone." His imitation of an auctioneer
was excellent, and with this send-off the biplanes
bolted for Przemysl.</p>

<p>The pilots themselves knew the route this time,
and they sent the biplanes over the course at sixty
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Three times they were over the fire of long-range
guns, but too high for harm.</p>

<p>Settling in the fortress enclosure, their initial
greeting came from Stanislaws.</p>

<p>"Here's a cure for sore eyes."</p>

<p>This delighted individual capered around the
welcome incomers like a dancing master.</p>

<p>The garrison received with acclaim the news that
Roque conveyed.</p>

<p>They had been advised in a general way by wireless
from the nearest Austrian point of the upcoming
of the German reinforcements, and this confirmation
in person and in detail added to the enthusiasm
created by the first report.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Roque to his pilots, the next
evening, "I am seeking a sight of the gray lines
again, and there's another hard flight in store for
you. So get a good night's rest. We start at daybreak."</p>

<p>Facing a bitter, biting wind, the aviators left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Przemysl at dawn, and when they, numbed but undaunted,
finally reached the far-away German lines
it was a battle front that they crossed. There the
atmosphere was being warmed by gunpowder
flashes, and below was burning petrol, thawing out
the ground that the troops might dig themselves in.</p>

<p>Before the entrenchments, in wide range, combined
forces of Austrians and Germans were locked
in a life and death struggle with Russian contenders
for the possession of Warsaw&mdash;a bloody
repetition in one spot of the never ending conflict.</p>

<p>Though completing a continuous flight of seven
hours, the aviators were there offered no temptation
to alight. Hovering over the banks of the
Bzura they saw a German cavalry detachment all
but totally destroyed by the exploding of a Russian
mine, and in turn the big guns of the Germans cut
wide swathes in the Muscovite ranks.</p>

<p>Schneider cheered or groaned as the tide of battle
swept forward and back, when victory favored
or defeat menaced his comrades in the fray. The
firebrand, in every quivering fiber, madly craved
the chance to brave the shot and shell on the blackened
battlefield.</p>

<p>He saw a German color bearer go down in the
press of a hand-to-hand conflict, and as the mass
was dissolved by artillery fire, that one still figure,
among the many scattered in the open, presented
irresistible appeal to the soldier-aviator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Land me, boy&mdash;have you the red blood to do
it? Have you the courage, lad? You have, I
know. Do it, lad&mdash;do it now!"</p>

<p>With his incoherent address, the big observer
spasmodically clutched the shoulders of the young
pilot.</p>

<p>Carried away by the vehement pleading of the
man behind him, Henri set the planes for a straight
fall.</p>

<p>Schneider bounded from the skimming machine,
made it the work of a few seconds to reach the
flag, which the dead man had wrapped around his
body, and as quickly returned.</p>

<p>The powerful motors drove the biplane up and
across the field, with the colors trailing over the
shoulders of the observer, who, in his excitement,
sang a mighty war song.</p>

<p>This deed of daring, directly in view of the
trenches, and under the very eye of the German
commander and staff, raised a tremendous cheer.</p>

<p>Of all this Schneider seemed oblivious. His
was a blind patriotism.</p>

<p>Roque wore a look of mild reproach when he
encountered Henri behind the lines that night, but
he could not resist the prompting of forgiving admiration
when Schneider stood before him in attitude
of apology.</p>

<p>"Had no orders, of course, boss, but something
stuck to my crazybone, and everything went."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will have something stuck on the breast
of your coat, or I am very much mistaken," said
Roque, extending his hand, which Schneider
grasped with fervor.</p>

<p>That "something" was to be the Iron Cross, the
famous decoration for valorous service, and the
most coveted distinction in the German empire, a
badge of courage woven into its military history.</p>

<p>"Were this boy a soldier of and for the Fatherland,"
solemnly continued Roque, "the royal gift
might well be bestowed upon him."</p>

<p>Schneider threw an arm around the shoulders
of the young aviator. "Of nothing else is he lacking
to claim the honor," feelingly maintained the
big fellow, and his eyes were moist as he spoke.</p>

<p>Henri shook his head. Then with a roguish
glance at his chum, he said:</p>

<p>"The only medal I am hankering after is the one
Billy and I are expecting for making the first aëroplane
flight across the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"Have the 'made in Germany' mark on your machine
and I believe you can establish the record,"
laughed Roque.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," exclaimed Billy. "We are
going to build the crossing craft ourselves."</p>

<p>The No. 3's were lying idle behind the lines.
Roque had ceased overground work for the time
being, and like a mole was engaged in some undermining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
scheme, of which the boys had no inkling.</p>

<p>Resorting to his remarkable aptitude as a lightning
change artist, and also applying the magic
touch to Schneider, the pair of them were scarcely
recognizable to even the lads with whom they had
been so long and so closely associated.</p>

<p>The secret agent and his trusty lieutenant were
masquerading as natives of Russian Poland, and
it may be told that their desperate mission was
to enter Warsaw, where the slightest indiscretion
or betrayal would put them in graves alongside of
that daring spy of Roque's who failed to conceal
his identity.</p>

<p>It was the midnight hour when Billy was awakened
by a man enveloped from neck to foot in a
grayish-brown overcoat, from under the head cape
of which came the voice of Roque:</p>

<p>"Take this" (slipping a fold of coarse paper into
the hand of the drowsy lad), "and if you do not
hear from me after three days, read what is written,
and follow the instructions to the letter. Not
a look at the message, remember, for three days; to
be exact, the morning of the fourth day. You hear
me?" Billy sleepily nodded his head.</p>

<p>Out on the turbid tide of the yellow river beyond
the German trenches two shrouded figures
silently launched a flatboat and drifted away in the
darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's doing?" This was Henri's morning
question, preceding a swallow of coffee.</p>

<p>"If I knew what was in here I could probably
tell you a whole lot that I don't know at present."</p>

<p>Billy displayed the closely folded packet containing
Roque's instructions.</p>

<p>When Henri was advised of the conditions imposed
he accepted the trust as a matter of course.</p>

<p>It had never been a habit of the boys to break
faith.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />

<small>HELD IN WARSAW.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> din of battle had long since ceased to be
an inspiration of terror with the Boy Aviators.
They were case-hardened by continual contact with
the war game, and too careless, perhaps, of flying
lead.</p>

<p>Reclining in the trenches, they indulged in all
sorts of surmises as to the whereabouts of Roque
and Schneider, wagered back and forth, one way
and the other, on the proposition of whether the
chief would appear in person within the allotted
time or put it up to them to interpret the message
in Billy's pocket.</p>

<p>With the passing of two days, the hours in the
next one seemed to move on leaden wings.</p>

<p>"I don't even know in what direction to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
for his coming," complained Henri. "If he is coming,"
he corrected himself.</p>

<p>"No use getting in a stew about it," advised Billy,
concealing the fact that he himself was nearing
the boiling point as the last few hours of waiting
wore away.</p>

<p>The morning of the fourth day, and no sign or
sight of the absentees.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri sat in council, and the former
opened the paper that had haunted his dreams during
the previous restless night.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p>"If alive, we are in Warsaw."</p></div>

<p>"I guessed that once." Billy lifted his eyes from
the paper.</p>

<p>"Go on," impatiently urged Henri.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p>"Of either fact you may learn by following instructions.
You are to bring both biplanes, early
morning, and circle over the city. In the south
section you will note tall column with figure on
top in center of square. Back of same is elevation
on which rise two towers. Watch these. If one
flag shows, hold over high road running west; if
two flags, sail north and land at lodge house where
canary sang for us. There wait. If highroad route
(one flag), see red scarf signal for drop. When
you read and commit these lines destroy."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a system that old fox controls," observed
the reader. "Killing one of his men didn't close
the show in Warsaw. Do you get all this, pard?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," asserted Henri, "but let me go
over it again to be sure."</p>

<p>Both boys having Roque's communication pat
in their minds, Billy tossed it into the flames of
the nearest campfire.</p>

<p>The aviation lieutenant serving with the division
gave them free reign and all possible assistance in
preparing for their flight. He asked no questions.</p>

<p>Crossing the river, the young aviators ascended
to great altitude, hardly visible to any casual ground
view, and taking lower levels gradually over the
city. Each with an eye on the compass, the pilots
mentally rehearsed their instructions.</p>

<p>Operating in unison, though a hundred yards or
more apart, they checked speed when sighting the
burnished tower tops showing above all other structures
on the south line, first identified by the tall
column and its surmounting statue in the square.</p>

<p>The aërial maneuvering continued for a seeming
quarter of an hour, and while the sun rays
splintered on the glistening turrets over which they
were keeping vigil, no other manifestation appeared.</p>

<p>Through this long exposure to the danger of
attracting unwelcome attention, the boys were momentarily
expecting some aëroplane demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
from the Russian military camps showing to the
east.</p>

<p>On the highroad, finally, the aviators saw two
horsemen galloping their mounts towards the hill,
and then lost to view between the twin bases of
the towers.</p>

<p>A flag swung out from one of the tiny windows
under the gilded domes.</p>

<p>One flag:</p>

<p>The signal to hold over the road, which stretched
whitely for a mile or more and merged into the
fertile fields without the city.</p>

<p>The red scarf next. Would it call the suspended
biplanes in swift swoop to the earth?</p>

<p>Skilled hands gripped the levers in readiness to
instantly respond to the signal.</p>

<p>A cart with two muffled figures in it rumbled
leisurely down the road. There was no urging of
the sorry steed straining at its belled collar.</p>

<p>The biplanes perceptibly lowered, though it was
merely guess work on the part of the aviators. The
movement of the cart might have been just one of
ordinary traffic, the occupants just plain, everyday
peasants.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hovering airmen got a signal, but
not the expected flash of scarlet. One of the
carters, a big fellow, rose from his seat and frantically
waved his arms, and the boys were then so
near that they could plainly see that he varied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
queer performance by pointing skyward with the
long whip he was holding.</p>

<p>So intent had been the aviators in trailing the
cart that they had neglected for a time to look elsewhere
about them.</p>

<p>The gestures of apparent warning that they were
witnessing returned their wits to normal, and what
they had from the first low flight feared was about
to be realized. Barely a half mile away, and buzzing
toward them, were three aëroplanes, which,
unnoticed by the otherwise engaged lads, had risen
from the Russian camp.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, now wholly confident that the
antics that had awakened them to the impending
peril were those of no other than Schneider, gave
that good friend a parting salute of cap waving
and turned about at full speed to lead a stern chase
over and beyond the city&mdash;far beyond, it proved.</p>

<p>The pursuing biplanes, of the largest type, carried
a crew of three men each, and that they had
tremendous motor power was evidenced by their
catapult coming.</p>

<p>But, light-weighted, the No. 3's were not to be
easily overhauled. It must have been a contrary
spirit that induced Billy and Henri to do other than
head across the river to the German camp.</p>

<p>They were in their element, however, and it was
the kind of exploiting that most appealed to them.
Keeping out of range of the guns of their armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
pursuers was the first care, and no other care had
the lads how long the chase continued.</p>

<p>They would even hold, as a bait to keep the fun
going. That grave consequences might follow capture
was not at all an issue. The boys had no
thought of aught else than that they were jockeying
in an aëroplane race.</p>

<p>How far afield they had driven they did not realize
until with waning day they had outdistanced
their pursuers.</p>

<p>They were compelled to land in strange territory,
for they feared to take the chance of exhausting
the supply of petrol carried by the aëroplanes,
and, besides, the continued strain on the
aviators themselves was beginning to tell.</p>

<p>"Oh, for a 'lodge in some vast wilderness,'"
spouted Billy in actor style. He had a very pleasant
memory of that lodgekeeper's kitchen, in which
they, cold and hungry, had been warmed and fed.
"I'd like mighty well," he added, "to hear that
canary twitter right now."</p>

<p>"Barring all that," remarked Henri, "we might
be in a worse fix, considering that we have something
to eat with us and a good pair of blankets for
a bed."</p>

<p>"I am not particularly impressed with these surroundings,
though," argued Billy, "a swamp on
one side, a bunch of stunted willows on the other,
and a regular no man's land front and back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, quit your kicking, Buddy, and let's make
the best of it."</p>

<p>Henri started for the willows, in the hope of
finding enough dry material to make a fire.</p>

<p>He succeeded in coaxing a small blaze out of a
little pile of twigs.</p>

<p>Dead tired, the boys rolled into their blankets
and slept like logs. But they had a rude awakening,
particularly in the case of Billy.</p>

<p>As he lay snoring, a flash more vivid than lightning
dragged him out of dreamland, and his hands
flew to his eyes to protect them from the blinding
glare. A searchlight was playing full on his face.
He heard the clatter of horses' hoofs, and before
he could see what was happening, a hand was on
his shoulder and a revolver was pressed against
his breast.</p>

<p>Henri, startled into sitting posture, looked dazedly
upon the proceedings.</p>

<p>A Russian cavalryman, dismounted, was behind
the revolver, and the searchlight was directed from
a wagon.</p>

<p>A stalwart figure in gold and brown, an officer
in the service of the Czar, moved briskly into the
circle of light to inspect the prisoners.</p>

<p>Stroking his tawny mustache, he concluded brief
comment with a short laugh. Translated, what he
said was:</p>

<p>"You have caught a pair of lambs, Peter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier addressed as Peter hastily restored
the revolver to his belt.</p>

<p>Another soldier just then discovered the biplanes,
and the officer deemed this find of great importance.
He tried the French language on the boys in starting
a series of blunt questions.</p>

<p>"Who and what are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Aviators by profession, foreigners by birth, and
prisoners because we couldn't help ourselves."</p>

<p>The officer smiled at Henri's smart answer.</p>

<p>"I suppose you came to this spot in those machines?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Henri, less snappy in tone.</p>

<p>"We will hear more from you when we get to
Warsaw," advised the Russian.</p>

<p>"Shades of Tom Walker," thought Henri, "'out
of the frying pan into the fire.'"</p>

<p>"Peter and I will go along with you by the air
route," proposed the officer; "I like the looks of
those machines. We need them. Now, Peter, you
must not let your pilot run away with you."</p>

<p>Peter grinned and tapped the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>Captain Neva, for such was the Russian officer's
title and name, was a rather advanced amateur in
knowledge of aircraft, and he shrewdly estimated
the value of the prizes that had come to his hand
on this night's march. The subaltern, Peter, had
also some flying experience, though he preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a good horse under him rather than a board, and
he, too, noted the fine points of the No. 3's.</p>

<p>"A pretty present for the general, my captain,"
he rejoiced, "and all ready for delivery."</p>

<p>The boys were given a substantial breakfast, and
Henri learned that they were about 150 miles north
of Warsaw. As this was figured on straight line
measurement, the aviators realized that in the excitement
of yesterday's racing they must have left
the direct course many times, for considering the
time they were in the air and the speed maintained,
150 miles was not a great distance.</p>

<p>From one of the many wagons, loaded with ammunition
and military supplies of all sorts, was
produced a fresh supply of petrol for the biplanes.</p>

<p>"You see, we have quite a number of these flying
machines up in Warsaw," explained Captain
Neva to Henri, "and we are carrying plenty of
this stuff to feed them."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the biplanes were off for Warsaw,
Henri and the captain in one machine, Billy
and Peter in the other.</p>

<p>Three hours later the boys walked behind the
captain into army headquarters, and soon into the
presence of a man of most distinguished bearing,
in full field uniform of a Russian general. Though
gold lace sparkled on his shoulders and his cuffs,
the striking note of his attire was the orange and
black ribbon of the Cross of St. George that appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
along the buttoned edge of his field coat.</p>

<p>Captain Neva presented the compliments of his
colonel, told of the near approach of the supply
wagons and convoying troops, and mentioned the
handsome addition to the aërial fleet so luckily and
peculiarly acquired. The captain's brief relation
of the latter incident, a little break in the pall of
war, seemed to interest the general, for he glanced
at the lads, standing at respectful attention nearby.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked, speaking in
French, and looking directly at Henri.</p>

<p>The boy politely bowed and named himself.</p>

<p>"I would conclude from the sound that I have
spoken in a tongue within your complete understanding.
And the other?"</p>

<p>Henri registered Billy, name and nation.</p>

<p>The boy from Bangor flushed with gratification
when the general, in excellent American, called him
forward.</p>

<p>"You're a long way from home, young man."</p>

<p>Billy admitted the fact, and added, "I have been
wishing many times of late, sir, that the distance
could be reduced three-fourths and I had already
traveled the other fourth."</p>

<p>With the incoming of the staff members, reporting
from the front, the general consigned the boys
for the present to the custody of Captain Neva.</p>

<p>"They've wasted no time," observed Billy, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to the familiar lines of the No. 3's, glistening
with new color.</p>

<p>That a couple of Polish carters should happen to
be gaping at the aviation show was not an unusual
occurrence or usually worthy of notice.</p>

<p>But there are carters and carters, and some seeming
carters are not carters at all!</p>

<small>AN HOUR TOO SOON.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> incoming of the troops convoying the supply
train, Captain Neva rejoined his company, and
Billy and Henri were promptly adopted by the aviation
corps, most of whom spoke both French and
English, and all very much inclined to express their
admiration of the aëroplane knowledge displayed by
the youngsters.</p>

<p>The boys were right on the job, so to speak, when
it came to reassembling the parts of new aircraft
received by wagon shipment, and so grew in the
confidence of the aviation lieutenants that they
were quite often permitted to make flying tests of
the various machines with only themselves in
charge.</p>

<p>If the young airmen enjoyed this concession without
watching on the part of the lieutenants, there
was no such inattention on the part of a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
frequenters of a city tavern not far removed from
the aviation camp.</p>

<p>Work was evidently slack with this pair of citizens,
for hardly a day passed that they did not
spend several hours at a tavern table located near
a bow-window, which afforded an excellent view of
the parade ground and aviation quarters.</p>

<p>One of these constant spectators was remarkable
for his size and the vivid hue of his hair, the other
for the reason that he paid absolutely no heed to
the other patrons of the place, though all appeared
to be of his kind, both in manner and attire.</p>

<p>On a particular afternoon, the strangely silent
one was deeply engaged with a stump of a pencil
in the labor, no doubt, of casting up his accounts on
a piece of dirty brown paper, in which had been
wrapped his lunch of black bread and sausage.</p>

<p>The puckered lines over his nose indicated
thought labor, but the furtively keen glance he occasionally
gave to outside movement contradicted
the impression that he was of slow order of mind.</p>

<p>The chief actors in the mentioned "outside movement"
at the time were two trimly set up lads in
new suits of service green, one pulling and the other
pushing an armored biplane into its hangar.</p>

<p>"This machine," said the puller, "ran like an ice-wagon
to-day but maybe use will smooth her out."</p>

<p>"It's all in the motors," confidently asserted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
pusher, "and I'll have the kinks out of them in a
day or two."</p>

<p>The man at the table across the way had completed
his task, shoved the paper and pencil into
his pocket, and was placidly puffing a huge cigar.</p>

<p>His red-topped companion stamped into the room,
returning from some excursion in the city, but the
smoker did not pass a word of greeting, though the
other idlers filled in with noisy welcome.</p>

<p>It was not until the room had been vacated by
all but themselves that the curiously assorted pair
put their heads together.</p>

<p>"Ricker showed you where the ammunition was
stored?"</p>

<p>The red-topped nodded.</p>

<p>"You arranged for the plans with Westrich?"</p>

<p>Again the nod of assent, but this time with softly
spoken supplement:</p>

<p>"All good, but there is no chance of us getting
to the river now. It's lined with a wall of steel,
and even a rat could not pass, day or night, without
a triple stamp of authority on its back. And
let me tell you, if we light the match for that explosion
without an outlet, all the information we
will carry will be to the next world."</p>

<p>"If we cannot get through the wall of steel you
mention there might be a way of going over it."</p>

<p>The speaker gave a meaning glance out of the
window at the aviation camp. A biplane was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
rising for test flight, and it was manned by two
experts easily identified by the conspiring couple
in the tavern.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho, I see," mused the brick-top, "you expect
to use those boys in the matter of pulling us out."</p>

<p>"Why not? Have they ever failed us in extremity?
Is the peril greater than when they dived
into the canyon that our lease on life might be
lengthened; did they fail to respond to my summons
to do this very work of rescue, delayed through
no fault on their part?"</p>

<p>This subject had served to draw the clam out of
his shell, and he found relief in relaxing temporarily
his studied pose of stolid indifference.</p>

<p>"How are we going to get at them?" asked the
willing listener to the rapid-fire praise of the young
heroes.</p>

<p>The crafty secret agent (it was Roque, of course)
had not been wool-gathering during the silent hour
of his sitting at the table.</p>

<p>He had devised several ways of apprising the
boys that he needed their services and acquainting
them with a working plan that would enable them
all to sail out of Warsaw in safety.</p>

<p>Something was going to happen when he willed
it that would make the outward passage a memorable
one, and success or complete failure of the
project was in the close balance of a few more
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>In real truth, however, Roque did not so greatly
weigh his personal welfare as against the service
he could render by doing damage to the foe from
without as well as from within.</p>

<p>Ready for his call were papers of supreme import,
and to lose which at the hands of a searching
party would be a calamity the secret agent
dreaded even to anticipate.</p>

<p>By the air route he had determined to leave, if
by any hook or crook Schneider and himself could
get hold of an aëroplane.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri had been aloft for several hours,
enjoying a bird's-eye view of the really magnificent
city, for the possession of which carnage held sway
for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>"Some town this," Billy remarked as he stepped
from the machine, completing the sightseeing tour;
"after the war I'd like to start a branch factory
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, go 'way," laughed Henri, "it would take a
derrick to haul you out of Boston or Bangor, once
you set foot again in those burgs."</p>

<p>"You forget, old top," suggested Billy, "that we
have already on tap a comeback aëroplane trip
across the Atlantic. I'm no quitter."</p>

<p>From a coal-laden wagon the contents was being
shot into a chute running into the cellar of one
of the big houses taken over for officers' occupancy.</p>

<p>One of the grimy heavers, at sight of the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
came forward to meet them, wiping his hands on
the leather apron he wore, removed his fur cap,
and took therefrom a scrap of smutty brown paper
and tendered it to Billy.</p>

<p>"Guess he wants you to sign a receipt," said
Henri, looking over his chum's shoulder.</p>

<p>Billy's glance at the paper set him staring at
the man who presented it.</p>

<p>The latter never raised his eyes&mdash;he was using
them sidewise upon a group of soldiers standing
in front of the mess hall.</p>

<p>The boys saw in the scrawl these words: "Orders
for No. 3's, Two Towers, St. Michael road,
eight sharp, Thursday evening."</p>

<p>Without a word, Billy returned the paper to the
heaver. The officer of the day was approaching.
He signed the delivery receipt, but the paper had
queerly changed color in the handling.</p>

<p>As the lads slowly walked toward aviation headquarters
their minds were all in a whirl. Prisoners
they were and prisoners they had been, yet in
both instances it had been but the semblance of
captivity. While they were held, the rein had been
a loose one.</p>

<p>Just back of them the ties of long association,
immediately in front of them a trust imposed, a
generous parole, when they had gone to the limit
in giving the best of themselves, in the one capacity
they could serve, to the former rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Thursday evening at eight, and this was Tuesday
evening at six. Long enough, indeed, for the
boys to torment themselves with the reflection that
if they did not appear at the appointed hour Roque
and Schneider would curse their perfidy, and if
they did betray the confidence of the aviation chief
in this camp he would pay the penalty.</p>

<p>"It will be no trick at all to take the biplanes for
an evening spin; we have done it before without
question."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble, Henri", lamented Billy, "it's
too easy. If we had to steal the machines, risk
our lives before the guns of the sentries, and all
that sort of thing, it wouldn't seem such a trial of
conscience. But they take us on trust, and without
question."</p>

<p>"Yet, here's Roque and Schneider in the lurch,
and looking to us for aid. With them we have
met about all that is coming to a fellow in this war
zone, except death, and pretty near that; we have
eaten and slept and starved together."</p>

<p>"There you are again, Henri, and it's 'twixt the
devil and the deep blue sea!' any way you put it."</p>

<p>Thursday morning, and as clear as a bell. The
Boy Aviators looked red-eyed on the smile of nature.
Their cots had squeaked protest all through
the night against the tossing of the uneasy nappers.</p>

<p>At noon they had about made up their minds
to keep the appointment at Two Towers, and seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to strengthen this resolution they avoided in
every way they could meetings with the aviation
chief.</p>

<p>Along about three in the afternoon the wavering
youngsters had arranged a compromise, this
to be positive. They would deliver the No. 3's to
their former owner for choice, and so enable their
old friends to get safely away. As for themselves,
they proposed to return to camp and "take their
medicine"&mdash;their dose and the portion that the aviation
chief would otherwise be likely to get.</p>

<p>But fate shuffled it another way.</p>

<p>The workday was in the closing minutes. The
remaining city thousands who were not in military
service were swelling the stream of homegoers in
the busy streets.</p>

<p>The driver of a coal wagon, which had drawn
up before an imposing structure devoted to the storage
of army supplies, and supposed to contain an
immense supply of ammunition, suddenly conceived
the notion that he was doing overtime duty. At
least such was his manner when one of the Big
Ben clocks overhead ding-donged the hour of six.
Perhaps, too, the movement of gathering up reins
and whip had its measure of prompting in the appearance
of the driver's mate from some underground
space in the big building.</p>

<p>At any rate, the old nags dragging the heavy
vehicle were given the full benefit, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
warning, of a long and knotted whip-lash, and covered
several city blocks at a lively gait before they
realized that they were traveling out of their class.</p>

<p>The heaver who had emerged from the building
in response to the clock summons showed tremor
of the hands when he lifted them to draw the cape
of his greatcoat closer about his throat.</p>

<p>"It's set for eight," he hoarsely whispered; "I
turned the key when I heard the strokes outside."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the wagon kept a course directly
to a residence section at once fashionable
and quiet, and hardly the possible location of a
coal yard or the home, either, of a humble employee
thereof.</p>

<p>One of the men in the wagon, the fellow with
the hoarse whisper, left the vehicle in a square
marked by a tall column with a statue on top, while
the driver continued the urging of his horses up
the ever ascending street.</p>

<p>Gaining the level above, the horses were given
their own heads, which meant a snail's pace. Close
at hand were two towers of considerable height.</p>

<p>While the horses plodded on the highroad stretching
to the west, pressure on their bits was lacking.
The wagon was empty.</p>

<p>Two figures appeared on the terrace back of the
twin towers, these terraces rising in tiers from the
bank of the fast-flowing river below.</p>

<p>"You left Ricker in the square?" This question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
put by the man who evidently had just returned
from a mission that did not include a ride in a coal
wagon.</p>

<p>"He left me, rather," replied the late driver, with
a touch of grim humor.</p>

<p>The first speaker held a watch in his hand, consulting
it frequently, holding it closer and closer to
his eyes as the light faded before the advance of
night's shadows.</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock," he announced. "Another hour."</p>

<p>This was the last notation of time by the watch
holder.</p>

<p>There was an explosion that, notwithstanding the
distance, seemed to shake the everlasting hills to
their very foundations.</p>

<p>The men on the terrace stared aghast, each at
the other.</p>

<p>"The die is cast," cried the one with the commanding
voice, "and an hour too soon!"</p>

<small>A LEAP FOR LIBERTY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Boy Aviators had just left the mess hall,
and were proceeding to the hangars where the No.
3's were housed, fully intending to carry out their
compromise plan of giving Roque and Schneider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the means to escape, and return themselves as hostages
for the honor of the aviation chief.</p>

<p>Shortly before seven o'clock on this eventful
evening, Billy and Henri had the biplanes in order
for the arranged visit to St. Michael road, and the
delivery of one or both of the machines to their
former owner, supposedly in waiting in the shadow
of the two towers.</p>

<p>"It is really a relief that the time is drawing
nigh for us to get off the rack. I believe we are
doing the square thing, but sure we have had few
easy moments during these last forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>Billy heaved a sigh when reviewing this disturbing
experience.</p>

<p>Henri turned just then to salute the aviation
chief. The boy's greeting had none of the cheery
note usually there. He did not know how it would
be several hours hence.</p>

<p>"Looks like a chance for you boys on the next
dispatch trip to Petrograd," advised the chief; "we
can illy spare more than two at a time of our regular
air scouts, and here's a deal by which we have
two extra machines and a pair of pilots thrown in."</p>

<p>With their minds clear and no cloud like the
one looming ahead, the prospect of biplaning to the
wonder city of Russia would have set the boys on
the top floor of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>As it was, they could only say that they would
welcome the work if it should be assigned to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The aviation chief had hardly taken a dozen
steps in his continuing round of inspection when
there was a shakeup that might have come by a
combination of volcano and earthquake.</p>

<p>"Geeminy!" gasped Billy, clapping his hands to
his ears, "somebody must have fired a ton of powder!"</p>

<p>A roll of drums preceded the hasty assembling
of several regiments in this division, and a squadron
of cavalry jingled madly down the street.</p>

<p>"That was a whopper, all right," exclaimed
Henri, righting himself after his first little stagger
from the shock, "but big noises ought not to queer
us, pard. Get in and get away."</p>

<p>Following his chum's example, Billy was close
behind the former in upward flight.</p>

<p>They could see that the streets below held literally
surging masses of humanity, all trending in
the same direction.</p>

<p>The aviators speedily gained an idea of what had
happened. That which only the other day they
had observed as a solid front of granite and iron on
a building covering practically a whole city square
had fallen in ruins, completely blockading the broad
avenue it had faced.</p>

<p>About the square a cordon had been drawn, and
it could be seen, even through the dusk, that troops
were spreading fan-shape from this point throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the entire northern section, while the police
darted right and left and everywhere.</p>

<p>The select neighborhood of St. Michael road had
not been omitted from the general round-up, the
boys found, when they approached the site of the
two towers.</p>

<p>It seemed that the abandoned team and wagon
had been found somewhere along the highroad, and
as suspicion was now acute, the discovery set the
fine-comb going along every terrace and police poking
in every likely hiding-place.</p>

<p>There had been instant acceptance of the theory
that the storehouse and magazine had been deliberately
blown up by the cunning contrivance of a
spy or spies within the city.</p>

<p>Every stranger must give an account of himself,
and even some individuals here and there who were
not newcomers.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri could see no opening where two
full length military biplanes could alight without
notice, and not a morsel of encouragement to try
for negotiation on the quiet with the disguised
secret agent who had summoned them.</p>

<p>But the aviators hung about, not knowing what
else to do for the present, thinking that Roque
would make a showing of some sort, as he usually
did in tight places.</p>

<p>Flying lower and lower, the two biplanes were
sweeping within earshot of the terraced heights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
along the river front, and though now of dim vision,
searching parties could be seen flashing lights up
and down the ground tiers.</p>

<p>There was a hullabaloo breaking out on the lowest
terrace, immediately overhanging the river&mdash;a
shot&mdash;another and another&mdash;like a bunch of firecrackers,
so fast did they follow!</p>

<p>A stentorian note of defiance, a rush, two shapes
springing out into space, a great splash in the icy
waters below!</p>

<p>If the morning revealed a single trace of the daring
fugitives dead or alive, no word of it reached
the aviation camp, to which the young airmen had
returned, conscious that of this mission they were
acquitted.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I can't help believing that they
got across?"</p>

<p>Henri had a thought, perhaps, of the rabbit's
foot that Schneider carried.</p>

<p>The boys had many under-the-breath discussions
as to the possible connection of Roque with the explosion
that had destroyed the war depot. They
had no reckoning that in the little shop of a silversmith,
not far removed from the very column and
statue that had twice served them as a guide-post,
the whole story might have been told by a wily confederate
posing as a peaceful artisan. This same
man could also have confessed to the first error of
his expert career in the handling of a time-clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>With plots and counterplots, however, the young
aviators had no time or inclination to meddle. They
would rather work in the open.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that lieutenant meant what he said
about giving us a peek at Petrograd?"</p>

<p>Billy put the question to his chum as they contemplated
with satisfaction a particularly neat job
of aëroplane repair they had just completed.</p>

<p>"Don't see why he should say it if he did not
mean it," replied Henri. "Next time he comes
this way there would be no harm in reminding him
of what he said."</p>

<p>It so happened that the aviation chief at the very
moment was headed for the hangars. He was accompanied
by two officers of apparent high rank,
who gave the various types of aircraft close and
critical inspection.</p>

<p>When the No. 3's came to their notice, one of
the officers, a grizzled veteran, with a livid scar
showing from temple to chin, halted with a pointed
word of commendation.</p>

<p>"There's speed, balance and strength for you.
Where were they built?"</p>

<p>The aviation chief explained.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said the officer, "the paint only is
ours. Well, I think we need look no further. Get
them ready for immediate use. Where are the pilots
for this assignment?"</p>

<p>A call was passed for Billy and Henri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>When they faced the official visitors, both of
the latter turned a stare full of question marks at
the aviation chief.</p>

<p>"Are these the sons of our pilots to be?"</p>

<p>The senior colonel meant to be a bit sarcastic.</p>

<p>"No; but if the fathers really were as remarkably
skilled in the high art of aëroplaning as 'the
sons' you see here, I would request the general to
let me go after them without delay."</p>

<p>The airman was very much in earnest in his
firm but respectful effort to correct the impression
of his superiors in command that he had been guilty
of some error of judgment.</p>

<p>Henri unconsciously contributed another entering
wedge when he gave his name to the younger of
the colonels, who had taken a hand in the examination
of the youthful candidates proposed by the
aviation lieutenant for special aëroplane service.</p>

<p>"Trouville!" exclaimed the officer; "are you of
the house founded by the first François and the
motto 'Sans Peur'?" (Without Fear.)</p>

<p>"That's in my family record, sir," admitted
Henri, who could not imagine what on earth his
ancestry had to do with his ability to run an aëroplane.</p>

<p>"Then you will find an open door in Petrograd,"
proclaimed the colonel, "that of my father, who in
his day of travel was often a guest at the Château<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Trouville, when your grandfather lived and they
were kindred spirits in the world of art."</p>

<p>"Château Trouville and its art treasures are no
more," sadly recalled Henri.</p>

<p>"My father will mourn with you there," assured
the colonel.</p>

<p>Another assurance came from the aviation chief
when the officers had returned to army headquarters
to assist in the preparation of dispatches that
were to go forward by aëroplane within the hour.
Said the lieutenant:</p>

<p>"It is settled, my flying friends, that you are
to go on this journey, which is imperative, owing
to the investment of railroad connections. The
observers behind you will point out the route, and
easy to follow, as the river is ever in sight. As
to the rest, you need no instructions."</p>

<p>"We are ready to start at the drop of a hat, sir,"
declared Billy. The boys had tuned the No. 3's
to the point of perfection.</p>

<p>The observers and dispatch bearers, Marovitch
and Salisky, honor men in the service, soon appeared,
hooded and enveloped in furs.</p>

<p>The first named handed Henri a card. "From
Colonel Malinkoff," he said. The boy saw that
it contained the words "He is a Trouville," signed
"Alexander," and directing to a certain street and
number in Petrograd. Henri carefully pocketed
the valuable reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early afternoon the young aviators had
their first view of the capital city of the Russians,
at the mouth of the Neva, and they made landing
upon a massive granite quay on the south bank of
the big river.</p>

<p>As the boys walked with the special messengers
to Admiralty Place, they marveled at the colossal
proportions of the public buildings, and looking up
and down one magnificent avenue, five or six miles
in length and 130 feet wide, Billy squeezed the elbow
of his comrade, with the awed comment:
"There's all outdoors in that street."</p>

<p>"That's the Nevskoi Prospekt," advised Marovitch.</p>

<p>"The very name on the colonel's card," cried
Henri, "Malinkoff palace, too."</p>

<p>"Know it very well," put in Salisky, "a twenty-minute
ride, and you are there."</p>

<p>When the dispatches were delivered the boys
were not present, but there was no lack of interest
for them outside. Standing near the copper-inlaid
doors through which the messengers had passed
were a number of Cossacks, dressed in scarlet, gold-braided
caftans, white waistcoats and blue trousers.</p>

<p>"That's a fancy looking bunch," whispered
Billy; "I guess they are something extra. And&mdash;say,
Buddy, if my eyes don't deceive me that fellow
in the middle, the one with the bushiest beard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
is no other than the boss of the crowd who shoved
us in the cellar over in Galicia!"</p>

<p>"Cracky, what a pair of eyes you've got, old
scout, and sure it's the very same, though he doesn't
look as rusty as he did then."</p>

<p>Henri seemed to be fascinated by the discovery,
and watched like a hawk every movement of the
old enemy in the new garb.</p>

<p>About that time the Cossack happened to cast
a glance in the direction of the spot where the boys
were stationed, and two pairs of eyes met in a single
flash. In the fierce orbs, and under the beetling
eyebrows of the knight of the mountains and deserts,
the flash plainly conveyed a puzzled expression.
Henri lowered his look. This risk of recognition
was more than he intended his bid to bring.</p>

<p>Turning away, the boy sought to show his indifference
of the now strained situation. He managed
to get an aside to Billy, in effect:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've put my foot in it now."</p>

<p>With the reappearance of Marovitch and Salisky,
Henri, in subdued tone, requested information regarding
their brilliantly attired neighbors.</p>

<p>"Why," responded Marovitch, "they are of the
personal escort of the Czar."</p>

<p>"Good-night," thought Henri, "it's a fix we are
into, and less than two hours in the town."</p>

<p>"How far did you say it was to the Malinkoff
palace?" he suddenly asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, about two miles up the Prospekt," said
Salisky.</p>

<p>"Hail one of those carryalls, please," requested
the aviator, pointing to the nearest stand of vehicles
for hire.</p>

<p>The Cossack had followed them, and was slowly
descending the marble steps just quitted by the
boys and their companions. He was evidently still
debating with himself.</p>

<p>The driver of the chartered vehicle cracked his
whip and carried his passengers up the street as
fast as his heavy horses could gallop.</p>

<p>With a speed ordinance he had no acquaintance.</p>

<small>AGAIN THEY WON OUT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Drawing</span> up with a flourish in front of a most
pretentious example of old-time architecture, the
fur shrouded jehu reached for his fare, which matter
was adjusted by Salisky, who had orders from
his colonel to see the boys through from start to
finish.</p>

<p>At the onyx-studded entrance of the palace the
party was halted by a gorgeous flunky, who immediately
unbent at a word from the useful Salisky.</p>

<p>"The colonel must belong up in the pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
here," suggested Billy, duly impressed by the surroundings.</p>

<p>"He is a great noble as well as a great soldier,"
reverently remarked Marovitch.</p>

<p>"Well," chuckled Billy, "I'm going to keep on
my shoes, even though I walk on velvet."</p>

<p>Salisky gave the lad a side glance of disapproval
of this levity, of which the young aviator took not
the slightest notice.</p>

<p>But Billy warmed to the gracious presence revealed
by cordial greeting in the spacious drawing-room.</p>

<p>The card from Colonel Malinkoff had preceded
the visitors.</p>

<p>With Marovitch and Salisky in the background,
the boys were ushered forward to meet a real, live
duke, but, withal, a kindly gentleman without a
mark or an affectation of exalted rank.</p>

<p>"Which, may I ask, is the Trouville, the grandson
of my old friend?"</p>

<p>Henri bowed acceptance of the honor. With
fine and delicate courtesy Billy was made to feel
that he was not counted a crowd by being the third
participant in a cozy chat.</p>

<p>The duke delighted in his memories of the close
alliance he had maintained with the house of Trouville,
and received with extreme regret the information
that the old château had been razed by the
engines of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"I well remember the underground passages, the
walled ways, the secret panels, and the like of the
ancient place."</p>

<p>Henri nudged his chum, and then briefly narrated
how the fortune of the Trouvilles had been
saved through the use of these same concealed avenues
and by the plan of the same two boys now
sitting in this drawing-room.</p>

<p>The old noble listened intently to the story, told
without embellishment or boast, and at the point
where Henri referred to the delivery of the treasure
to his mother the duke clapped his hands in applause.</p>

<p>"Salisky," he called to the special messenger, "I
desire to keep these young gentlemen as long as
possible. Is there an emergency that commands
their return?"</p>

<p>"Your grace," stated Salisky, "it grieves me to
say that it is most important that they serve as
pilots in our journey back to the front. Even now
dispatches are being prepared, and we must be on
the wing at sunrise to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Ah, the same duty that holds my son in its grip,
the call of country, and which by my infirmity of
years I may not answer. Not your country, my
boy, but your trust, nevertheless. But this is not
your last visit by many, I sincerely hope. A Trouville,
a Trouville," he muttered, "without fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, another thought, you have not broken bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with me." The duke struck a bell on the table at
his side.</p>

<p>The gorgeous flunky led the way to the smaller of
the dining-rooms, the other would have held a regiment,
and if the food was plain, on the war basis
of all alike, there was a bountiful service of it.</p>

<p>From the dining-room windows the Prospekt
could be seen, and Henri saw something besides
the Prospekt&mdash;several horsemen in parti-colored
uniforms pacing their mounts slowly up and down
in front of the palace.</p>

<p>He telegraphed with a wink to his chum, who
was seated with his back to the windows. Billy
took the tip, and managed to get an overshoulder
look on his own account.</p>

<p>The interest of the boys as to affairs inside instantly
began to flag. True, they were under powerful
protection for the time being, but there was
a later time coming.</p>

<p>The Cossack must have struck the lost chord in
his memory. There had since the encounter in
the Galician farmhouse been a life added to the
claim of the red rider&mdash;the duelist that Schneider
had forced over the cliff.</p>

<p>Henri had a game to play&mdash;playing for time.
Appeal to their host, for various reasons, did not
impress the boy as a desirable proceeding.</p>

<p>"There is no need of our going back to Admiralty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Place right away, is there, Salisky? We don't sail
until morning and we haven't even seen the paintings
here."</p>

<p>"The paintings"&mdash;here was a master stroke. The
duke was touched at a point nearest his heart.</p>

<p>"You must have at least a passing look," he insisted.</p>

<p>Salisky uneasily shook his head. "We have orders
to be within call from and after six o'clock,
and, sir, it is already very near that hour."</p>

<p>"Now, I will tell you what to do, Salisky; you
and your comrade here take my car, report yourselves,
and if it then be necessary for my young
friends to join you, return here for them. It is
only the matter of a very few minutes, either way."</p>

<p>Protesting under his breath, Salisky and his companion
heard the summons for the duke's automobile,
and were whirled away in that swift conveyance.</p>

<p>They could not understand the action of a company
of imperial Cossacks in ranging alongside of
the machine, and only withdrawing when the indignant
chauffeur sent the machine forward with a
vicious plunge.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and no word from the departed
special messengers.</p>

<p>The boys walked with the duke through his magnificent
gallery, but it is doubtful if they had any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
high appreciation of the treat. In every picture
they saw a Cossack wrapped in a rainbow.</p>

<p>Finally, observing their inattention, and attributing
it to anxiety on their part at the committing
of a breach of discipline, the duke instituted inquiry
as to the whereabouts of his chauffeur, intending
to forward the boys at once to Admiralty Place.
Neither driver nor machine could be found on the
premises.</p>

<p>Billy felt that it was his turn to get into the
figuring.</p>

<p>"It is such a fine evening, sir, and a straight
way, that, if it is all the same to you, Henri and
I would like the exercise of walking back to headquarters."</p>

<p>Henri could not fathom the scheme that his chum
was nursing, but he made no objection to the proposition.</p>

<p>The duke did not accompany the boys further
than the door of the art gallery, stating, with a
grim smile, that he had always with him a reminder
of his fighting days in the shape of a "game
leg." He gave them both a kindly farewell and
exacted a mutual promise of a longer visit next
time.</p>

<p>Behind the broad back of the flunky the lads proceeded
as far as the drawing-room, when Billy
"happened to think" that he had left his gloves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the dining-hall. There he looked for his missing
gloves&mdash;out of the window!</p>

<p>In the glow of the high-lights on the broad avenue
were revealed the gold-braided cavalrymen of
the earlier hours, still patiently pacing their horses
up and down in front of the palace.</p>

<p>"Tell his nobs to see if the automobile has arrived,"
softly urged Billy.</p>

<p>Henri sent the flunky ahead to investigate. He
guessed now, and correctly, that his chum did not
intend that they should leave by the front door.</p>

<p>Like ghosts they flitted through the dimly lighted
corridors of the palace, into the unknown backstairs
regions, hoping to find an easy outlet at the rear.</p>

<p>An open window coming handy, the boys essayed
a jump therefrom, landing on all fours in the walk
leading to the tradesman's gate. Darting out into
a side street, the fugitives relapsed into a brisk walk,
fearing to here excite suspicion by undue haste.</p>

<p>Alone in a great and strange city, as ignorant of
locality as of the language spoken by the average
inhabitant, Billy and Henri, as the former would
have put it, "were up against it, good and strong."</p>

<p>Yet they won out, and meeting the wildly searching
special messengers in the gray dawn, without
ado climbed into the pilots' places of the waiting
biplanes and sent the powerful machines in whirring
flight toward the distant towers of Warsaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>To follow them beyond this fixed destination is
to turn the leaves of the next record, under the
title of "Our Young Aëroplane Scouts in Russia;
or, Lost on the Frozen Steppes."</p>
